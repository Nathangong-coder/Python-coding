print('''\nWhich ballot measures are "routine" or\n"non-routine"?\nProposal 1 (election of directors), Proposal 3 (the approval, on an advisory\nbasis, of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers), Proposal 4 (the approval, on an\n6\nTable of Contents\nadvisory basis, of the frequency of holding a future advisory vote on executive compensation) and Proposal 5 (approval of the Amended 2020 Plan) are considered\nnon-routine\nmatters under applicable rules. A brokerage firm or other nominee cannot vote without instructions on a\nnon-routine\nmatter. Therefore, if you hold your\nshares in street name, it is critical that you give instructions on how to cast your vote with respect to these matters if you want your votes to count. If you do not instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote on these matters,\nno votes will be cast on your behalf.\nProposal 2 (the ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm\nfor Fiscal 2023) is considered routine under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee generally may vote on routine matters, and therefore no broker\nnon-votes\nare expected in connection with this matter.\nWhat vote is required to approve the proposals?\nDirector nominees up for election in Proposal 1 will each be elected by a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy.\nWe have adopted a majority voting policy for the election of directors, which is in line with current corporate governance best practices. Pursuant to\nthis voting policy, which applies in the case of uncontested director elections, a director must be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to the election of such director. For purposes of this policy, a "')
print("majority of the votes\ncast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director and abstentions and broker\nnon-votes\nare not counted as\n"votes cast." This voting policy provides that in the event that an incumbent director nominee receives a greater number of votes "against" than votes "for" his or her election, he or she must (within five business days\nfollowing the final certification of the related election results) offer to tender his or her written resignation from our Board to our NCG Committee. Our NCG Committee will review such offer of resignation and will consider such factors and\ncircumstances as it may deem relevant, and, within 90 days following the final certification of the election results, will make a recommendation to our Board concerning the acceptance or rejection of such tendered offer of resignation. The decision\nof our Board will be publicly disclosed.\nIn the case of contested elections, the required voting standard to be elected as a director will be a\nplurality voting standard. Under such plurality voting standard, the nominees receiving the most votes "for" their election at a meeting of stockholders at which a quorum is present would be elected to our Board (despite the amount of\n"against" or "withhold" votes, abstentions or broker\nnon-votes\nwith respect to any nominee).\nThe vote on the frequency of holding a future advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal 4) is advisory and\nnon-binding,\nand if none of the frequency options receive a majority of the votes cast, the option receiving the greatest number of votes will be considered the frequency recommended by the stockholders.\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes represented at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the\nmatter is required to ratify the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2023\n7\nTable of Contents\n(Proposal 2), to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal 3), and to approve the Amended 2020 Plan (Proposal 5).\nWith regards to Proposal 1 (election of directors), abstentions are not counted as either a vote cast "for" or "against" such\ndirector. With regards to Proposal 2 (ratification of KPMG's appointment as auditor), Proposal 3 (advisory vote on executive compensation), Proposal 4 (advisory vote on the frequency of a future advisory vote on executive compensation) and\nProposal 5 (approval of the Amended 2020 Plan), abstentions will be considered present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and will have the effect of a vote against each of these proposals because approval of each of these\nproposals requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote.\nHow are broker\n"non-votes"\nand abstentions treated?\nBroker\n"non-votes"\nand shares held as of the Record Date by holders who are present in person or\nrepresented by proxy at the Annual Meeting but who have abstained from voting or have not voted with respect to some or all of such shares on any proposal to be voted on at the Annual Meeting will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a\nquorum.\nAbstentions will: (i)\xa0have no effect on the outcome of the votes on Proposal 1 (election of directors) and Proposal 4 (advisory vote\non the frequency of a future advisory vote on executive compensation) because these proposals are determined by a plurality vote and (ii)\xa0have the effect of a vote against each of Proposal 2 (ratification of KPMG's appointment as auditor),\nProposal 3 (advisory vote on executive compensation) and Proposal 5 (approval of the Amended 2020 Plan) because approval of each of these proposals requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy\nat the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote.\nBroker', 'The Proxy Statement and Annual Report for this meeting are available at:': 'www.spectrumbrands.com\nIF YOU VOTE BY\nTELEPHONE OR INTERNET,\nPLEASE DO NOT MAIL YOUR CARD\nPlease detach at perforation before mailing.\nTHIS PROXY\nWHEN PROPERLY EXECUTED WILL BE VOTED IN THE MANNER DIRECTED HEREIN.
