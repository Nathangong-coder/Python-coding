each other item to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. A majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting.
Abstentions and broker nonvotes will be included in determining the presence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Internet Availability of Proxy

of Proxy Materials, instead of mailing or <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">e-mailing</FONT> copies of those materials. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials directs shareholders to a website where they can access our proxy
materials, including our proxy statement and our annual report, and view instructions on how to vote via the Internet, mobile device, or by telephone. If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and would prefer to receive a
paper copy of our proxy materials, please follow the instructions included in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. If you have previously elected to receive our proxy materials via <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">e-mail,</FONT>
you will continue to receive access to those materials electronically unless you elect otherwise. <B>We encourage you to register to receive all future shareholder communications electronically, instead of in print. This means that access to the
annual report, proxy statement, and other correspondence will be delivered to you via <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">e-mail.</FONT></B> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Proxy Voting

returned will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the directions given or, in the absence of directions, will be voted in accordance with the Board&#146;s recommendations as follows: &#147;FOR&#148; the election of each of the nominees
to the Board named herein; &#147;FOR&#148; the ratification of the appointment of our independent auditors; &#147;FOR&#148; approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive compensation as described in this Proxy Statement; and &#147;AGAINST&#148;
each of the shareholder proposals. It is not expected that any additional matters will be brought before the Annual Meeting, but if other matters are properly presented, the persons named as proxies in the proxy card or their substitutes will vote
in their discretion on such matters. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Voting via the Internet, mobile device, or by telephone helps save money by reducing postage and

meaning that your shares are represented by certificates or book entries in your name so that you appear as a shareholder on the records of Computershare, our stock transfer agent, you may vote by proxy, meaning you authorize individuals named in
the proxy card to vote your shares. You may provide this authorization by voting via the Internet, mobile device, by telephone, or (if you have received paper copies of our proxy materials) by returning a proxy card. You also may attend the Annual
Meeting and vote in person. If you own common stock of record and you do not vote by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting, your shares will not be voted. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you own shares in street name, meaning that your shares are held by a bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee, you may instruct that
institution on how to vote your shares. You may provide these instructions by voting via the Internet, mobile device, by telephone, or (if you have received paper copies of proxy materials through your bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee) by
returning a voting instruction form received from that institution. If you own common stock in street name and attend the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a &#147;legal proxy&#148; from the bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee that holds your
shares in order to vote your shares at the meeting. If you own common stock in street name and do not either provide voting instructions or vote at the Annual Meeting, the institution that holds your shares may nevertheless vote your shares on your
behalf with respect to the ratification of the appointment of Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young LLP as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December&nbsp;31, 2019, but cannot vote your shares on any other matters being considered at the meeting.

director shall be elected to the Board if the votes cast for such nominee&#146;s election exceed the votes cast against such nominee&#146;s election. If the votes cast for any nominee do not exceed the votes cast against the nominee, the Board will
consider whether to accept or reject such director&#146;s resignation, which is tendered to the Board pursuant to the Board of Directors Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues. Abstentions and broker nonvotes will have no effect on
the outcome of the election. Broker nonvotes occur when a person holding shares in street name, such as through a brokerage firm, does not provide instructions as to how to vote those shares and the broker does not then vote those shares on the
shareholder&#146;s behalf. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For all other matters proposed for a vote at the Annual Meeting, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter is required to approve the matter. For these matters, abstentions are not counted as affirmative votes on a matter but are counted as
present at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote, and broker nonvotes, if any, will have no effect on the outcome of these matters. </P>

structure improves the Board&#146;s ability to focus on key policy and operational issues and helps the Company operate in the long-term interests of shareholders. In addition, the independent directors on the Board have appointed a lead director

certain transactions, relationships, and arrangements involving some of the directors and concluded that such transactions, relationships, and arrangements did not impair the independence of the director. For Ms.&nbsp;Brewer and Mr.&nbsp;Weeks, the

in which those funds invest, and that Amazon has in the past and may in the future engage in transactions with companies in which these funds have invested. For Mr.&nbsp;Ryder, the Board considered that his <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT

continuity, and operational risks, the qualifications, independence, and performance of our independent auditors, the performance of our internal audit function, legal and regulatory matters, and our compliance policies and procedures. The

(&#147;SEC&#148;) rules. During the past year, the Audit Committee met with management and reviewed matters that included the Company&#146;s risk assessment and compliance functions, information security, public policy expenditures, treasury and
investment matters, accounting industry issues, the reappointment of our independent auditor, and pending litigation. The Audit Committee also met with the auditors to review the scope and results of the auditor&#146;s annual audit and quarterly

Leadership Development and Compensation Committee evaluates our programs and practices relating to leadership development, reviews and establishes compensation of the Company&#146;s executive officers, and oversees management of risks for succession
planning and our overall compensation program, including our equity-based compensation plans, all with a view toward maximizing long-term shareholder value. The Committee may engage compensation consultants but did not do so in 2018. Additional
information on the Committee&#146;s processes and procedures for considering and determining executive compensation is contained in the &#147;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&#148; section of this Proxy Statement. During the past year, the
Leadership Development and Compensation Committee met with management and reviewed matters that included the design, amounts, and effectiveness of the Company&#146;s compensation of senior executives, management succession planning, the
Company&#146;s benefit and compensation programs, the Company&#146;s human resources programs, including review of workplace discrimination and harassment reports, and feedback from the Company&#146;s shareholder engagement. </P>

assesses the composition of the Board, assists in identifying potential new candidates for director, recommends candidates for election as director, and provides a leadership role with respect to our corporate governance. The Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee also recommends to the Board compensation for newly elected directors and reviews director compensation as necessary. During the past year, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met with management and
reviewed matters that included the Board&#146;s composition, diversity, and skills in the context of identifying and evaluating new director candidates to join the Board, the Board&#146;s recruitment and self-evaluation processes, Board Committee
membership and qualifications, consideration of feedback from the Company&#146;s shareholder engagement, Board compensation, and corporate governance developments. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Director Nominations.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates for director who
are recommended by its members, by other Board members, by shareholders, and by management, as well as those identified by a third-party search firm retained to assist in identifying and evaluating possible candidates. Ms.&nbsp;Brewer and
Ms.&nbsp;Nooyi were each initially recommended to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee by a third-party search firm pursuant to a director recruitment process conducted in 2017 and 2018. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
annually reviews the tenure, performance, and contributions of existing Board members to the extent they are candidates for <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">re-election,</FONT> and considers all aspects of each candidate&#146;s qualifications and
skills in the context of the Company&#146;s needs at that point in time and, as stated in the Board of Directors Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues, seeks out candidates with a diversity of experience and perspectives, including
diversity with respect to race, gender, geography, and areas of expertise. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee includes, and has any search firm that it engages include, women and minority candidates in the pool from which the
Committee selects director candidates. When considering candidates as potential Board members, the Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluate the candidates&#146; ability to contribute to such diversity. The Board assesses
its effectiveness in this regard as part of its annual Board and director evaluation process. Currently, over half of our independent director nominees are women and over half of our independent director nominees have served for fewer than five
years. Our Board&#146;s composition also represents a balanced approach to director tenure, allowing the Board to benefit from the experience of longer-serving directors combined with fresh perspectives from newer directors (with three new directors
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">on-boarding</FONT> and three directors leaving in the last three years). The tenure range of our director nominees is as follows: </P> <P STYLE="font-size:12pt;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt">&nbsp;</P>

for the reporting process. The Audit Committee members do not serve as professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of management and the independent registered public
accounting firm. The Company&#146;s independent auditors are engaged to audit and report on the conformity of the Company&#146;s financial statements to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the effectiveness of the

financial reporting, and the independent auditors&#146; evaluation of the Company&#146;s system of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed with Ernst&nbsp;&amp; Young LLP, the Company&#146;s independent auditors,
the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#147;PCAOB&#148;) Auditing Standard 1301, <I>Communications with Audit Committees</I>. In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the

proposal, but we may disagree with how the proposal seeks to prescribe the manner in which we address the issue. We typically focus on initiatives and activities that can have the greatest impact given the specific nature of our operations, such as
our wind and solar farms to generate electricity and our frustration-free packaging initiatives, but we also have innumerable large and small initiatives underway at any point in time, as we seek to constantly invent across the company. For these
reasons, we generally oppose proposals requesting specific reports, policies, or initiatives for not reflecting the unique and evolving nature of our operations. Instead, we encourage you to read more about the many ways we are addressing these

disclosure of food waste levels, set targets for food waste reduction, and publish information on progress towards these goals. Unfortunately, Amazon has yet to report any company-wide food waste management strategy including context, metrics, and
quantitative improvement goals. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Action to reduce food waste is even more imperative for online grocery retailers because they may be more
susceptible to high rates of food waste given complex distribution systems and the inability to rely on solutions employed by conventional retailers. Amazon has captured 30% of U.S. online grocery spending, outpacing its peers. Amazon invested
heavily in its Amazon Fresh and Amazon Direct online grocery services, and spent $13.7&nbsp;billion to acquire Whole Foods, thereby increasing the company&#146;s exposure to products with greater rates of food waste and spoilage. </P>

decisions and implementing a number of grocery inventory management approaches that address food waste by minimizing the amount of food going to landfills (mirroring the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#146;s Food Recovery Hierarchy) and
putting excess food to better use. For example, Whole Foods Market maintains strong partnerships with food donation programs such as the Food Donation Connection, which reduces food waste by distributing unsold food to local food kitchens and
shelters. Similarly, in 2016 we launched a nationwide initiative to donate excess food to Feeding America, a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-profit</FONT> organization whose mission is to feed America&#146;s hungry through a nationwide network
of member food banks.<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">1</SUP> Through Feeding America, Amazon&#146;s U.S. fulfillment centers have donated millions of pounds of food to help those in need. We also have implemented food waste strategies

anaerobic digestion to create renewable energy, and animal feed programs, and Whole Foods Market team members are trained on food waste efficiency, from smart ordering to food donation. In addition, Whole Foods Market is continually assessing
emerging technologies and new opportunities to further increase its landfill diversion and recycling rates.<B><SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top"> </SUP></B>Our initiatives to address food waste supplement and support the many other

could expose shareholders to the risk of special meetings being called by a few shareholders focused on narrow or short-term interests, rather than the long-term best interests of the Company and shareholders generally. For example, event-driven
hedge funds could use special meetings to disrupt our business plans or to facilitate self-serving short-term financial strategies. Even if they are ultimately not able to obtain support from a majority of shares, those who might seek to call a
special shareholders meeting could subject us to considerable expense, distract management and the Board from important business initiatives, or seek self-interested concessions in exchange for avoiding a special meeting. Perhaps this is the reason
why, as of April 1, 2019, a majority of the 448 Fortune 500 companies surveyed by SharkRepellent.net that allow shareholders to call special shareholder meetings have set a threshold higher than that requested by the proponent. By setting the
ownership threshold for calling a special meeting at 30%, we are better able to ensure that a special meeting is called only when supported by a broad cross-section of our shareholders. </P>

Amazon&#146;s opposition to facilitating surveillance. In 2016, Amazon supported a lawsuit against government &#147;gag orders,&#148; stating: &#147;the fear of secret surveillance could limit the adoption and use of cloud services . . . Users

as importantly, for law enforcement and government agencies to catch criminals, prevent crime, and find missing people. New technology should not be banned or condemned because of its potential misuse; instead, there should be open, honest, and

Rekognition is a cloud-based application available to Amazon Web Services (&#147;AWS&#148;) customers that analyzes images or videos provided to the application. Amazon Rekognition&#146;s technology can be used to help identify objects, people,
text, scenes, and activities, as well as to detect any inappropriate content. Customers provide images and video they want to have analyzed, and Amazon Rekognition returns an output, including a confidence score indicating how accurate the service
believes the output to be. Customers then use the output for their own use cases. Since being introduced in 2016, Amazon Rekognition has been used to aid <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-profit,</FONT> advocacy, and government groups to rescue
victims of human trafficking, inhibit child exploitation, and reunite missing children with their families. It has also been applied extensively for various commercial uses, such as to identify public figures who are speaking at large events or live

generated output and selection of confidence levels, including a recommendation to set confidence levels at a high threshold (99%) in situations where high accuracy is important. In internal accuracy tests of Amazon Rekognition&#146;s facial
recognition features, AWS evaluated photos from a publicly available dataset of 1&nbsp;million face images and found zero false positive matches at a 99% confidence level. AWS plans to work with industry and academic groups that specialize in

STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-plus</FONT> years AWS has been offering Amazon Rekognition, AWS has not received a single report of Amazon Rekognition being used in the harmful manner posited in the proposal, but is aware of many beneficial purposes
of Amazon Rekognition, including by law enforcement to help improve public safety. We recognize that users of our technology, as with any technology, may not only utilize it for beneficial purposes, but could also misuse the results generated by our
technology, just as laptop computers, mobile phones or cameras can be misused. However, we do not believe that the potential for customers to misuse results generated by Amazon Rekognition should prevent us from making that technology available to
our customers. If AWS did receive reports that a customer (including any law enforcement customer) was misusing Amazon Rekognition, we would promptly investigate the report and, if the customer were found to be using Amazon Rekognition to violate
the law or the AWS terms of use or Acceptable Use Policy, we would prevent that customer from using the service. AWS will continue to work with partners across industry, government, academia, and community groups on this topic because we strongly
believe that facial recognition is an important, even critical, tool for business, government, and law enforcement use. In addition, to the extent there may be ambiguities or uncertainties in how existing laws should apply to facial recognition
technology, we have and will continue to offer our support to policymakers and legislators in identifying areas to develop guidance or legislation to clarify the proper application of those laws. We also support the calls for an appropriate national
legislative framework that protects individual civil rights and ensures that governments are transparent in their use of facial recognition technology. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-plus</FONT> years AWS has been offering Amazon Rekognition, AWS has not received a single report
of Amazon Rekognition being used in the harmful manner posited in the proposal, but is aware of many beneficial purposes of Amazon Rekognition, including by law enforcement to help improve public safety. We recognize that users of our technology, as
with any technology, may not only utilize it for beneficial purposes, but could also misuse the results generated by our technology, just as laptop computers, mobile phones or cameras can be misused. However, we do not believe that the potential for
customers to misuse results generated by Amazon Rekognition should prevent us from making that technology available to our customers. If AWS did receive reports that a customer (including any law enforcement customer) was misusing Amazon
Rekognition, we would promptly investigate the report and, if the customer were found to be using Amazon Rekognition to violate the law or the AWS terms of use or Acceptable Use Policy, we would prevent that customer from using the service. AWS will
continue to work with partners across industry, government, academia, and community groups on this topic because we strongly believe that facial recognition is an important, even critical, tool for business, government, and law enforcement use. In
addition, to the extent there may be ambiguities or uncertainties in how existing laws should apply to facial recognition technology, we have and will continue to offer our support to policymakers and legislators in identifying areas to develop
guidance or legislation to clarify the proper application of those laws. We also support the calls for an appropriate national legislative framework that protects individual civil rights and ensures that governments are transparent in their use of
facial recognition technology. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">By addressing technology that &#147;may &#133; threaten, or violate privacy and or civil rights&#148; and

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">According to its policy on offensive and controversial materials, &#147;Amazon does not
allow products that promote, incite or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual or religious intolerance or promote organizations with such views.&#148; (https://amzn.to/2mezrZt, accessed November&nbsp;19, 2018) </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Unfortunately, this policy appears to be applied inconsistently, which may indicate a lack of clear internal policies and effective controls.
While Amazon.com, Inc. (&#147;Amazon&#148;) has removed some offensive products, a July 2018 report found racist, Islamophobic, homophobic and anti-Semitic items on Amazon&#146;s platforms. (https://bit.ly/2tX37yK) As of November&nbsp;19, 2018,
searches on Amazon.com showed that offensive and controversial products continue to be available for sale through the platform. For instance, a search for &#147;Kek,&#148; a satirical religion associated with the white nationalist movement, returned
dozens of results, including Kek flags, which intentionally evoke the design of the Nazi war flag. (https://bit.ly/2puFOf9) </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The gap
between Amazon&#146;s stated policy and its practices is concerning. Making offensive products available could expose Amazon to reputational damage and impair relationships with key stakeholders including customers, regulators and employees. This is
particularly true as Amazon continues to pursue growth in more diverse and culturally complex international markets. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In both the European
Union and the United States other companies, including Ryanair and Waffle House, have faced boycotts for failing to address racism encountered by customers. Both Germany and the European Union have enacted laws restricting hate speech. For instance,
a German law requires the removal of hate speech within 24 hours and levies fines against companies that do not comply. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Amazon&#146;s

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board is committed to strong, independent leadership of the Board. The independent directors on the Board have appointed a lead director
from the Board&#146;s independent directors, currently Jonathan J. Rubinstein, former <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">co-CEO</FONT> of Bridgewater Associates, in order to promote independent leadership of the Board and address the governance
concerns listed in the shareholder proposal. The lead director presides over the executive sessions of the independent directors, chairs Board meetings in the Chair&#146;s absence, and provides direction on agendas, schedules, information, and
materials for Board meetings that will be most helpful to the independent directors. In addition, the lead director confers from time to time with the Chair of the Board and the independent directors and reviews, as appropriate, the annual schedule
of regular Board meetings and major Board meeting agenda topics. The guidance and direction provided by the lead director reinforce the Board&#146;s independent oversight of management and contribute to communication among members of the Board. The
Board believes that this leadership structure improves the Board&#146;s ability to focus on key policy and operational issues and helps us operate in the long-term interests of shareholders, while maintaining a strong, independent perspective. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, the Board believes flexibility in board leadership structure is more suitable for us than a rigid and prescriptive approach.
Instead, this proposal, if implemented, would require the Board to immediately remove Mr.&nbsp;Bezos from his position as Chair, rather than allowing the Board to, for example, assess the issue at some point in the future when there is a leadership
transition. We do not believe that such an immediate transition would be in the best interests of Amazon or our shareholders. Our directors have a fiduciary duty to routinely evaluate and determine the most appropriate leadership structure for
Amazon and its shareholders in </P>

light of our specific characteristics or circumstances at any given time. Accordingly, our governing documents provide the Board with the flexibility to determine the optimal leadership structure
for Amazon, including, when appropriate, separating the positions of Chair of the Board and CEO. The Board believes that Amazon and its shareholders benefit from this flexibility, and that the directors are best positioned to lead this evaluation
given their knowledge of our leadership team, strategic goals, opportunities, and challenges. The Board has selected our founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, as the Chair of the Board. The Board believes that Mr.&nbsp;Bezos&#146; role in founding Amazon and
his significant ownership stake in Amazon positions him well to work with the Board on the key policy and operational issues that will help us operate in the long-term interests of shareholders. In this regard, our stock has significantly
outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last 1, 3, 5, and <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-year</FONT> periods. For example, over the last five years, our stock has increased approximately 429% while the S&amp;P 500 has risen approximately 52%.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that it is important for the Board to continue to determine on a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">case-by-case</FONT></FONT> basis the most effective leadership structure for us, rather than take a rigid approach to board leadership, as called for by the shareholder proposal. In addition, in reviewing this proposal,
the Board took into consideration relevant benchmarking data and concluded that the proposal&#146;s approach is not common practice. For example, as of 2018, 50% of S&amp;P 500 companies combined the chairman and CEO roles, including
Berkshire-Hathaway, AT&amp;T, and General Electric,<SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">4</SUP> while a significantly lower percentage require the chair to be independent, as requested by this proposal. In addition, our existing corporate
governance practices reinforce the Board&#146;s alignment with, and accountability to, shareholders. Our current practices include annual election of directors, majority voting for each director, proxy access, an annual director evaluation process,
a shareholder right to call special meetings at which they can nominate director candidates or propose other business, a shareholder right to submit names of director candidates directly to the Board for consideration, and a shareholder right to
communicate directly with the Board in the manner described in our Board of Directors Guidelines on Significant Corporate Governance Issues. </P>

overall commitment to sharing our sustainability goals, we also announced that we plan to disclose our company-wide carbon footprint, along with related goals and programs, later this year. This is the result of a multi-year project to develop an

the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks out candidates with a diversity of experience and perspectives, including diversity with respect to race, gender, geography, and areas of expertise. Among the qualifications and skills of a

willingness to take appropriate risks; leadership ability; human capital management; personal and professional ethics, integrity, and values; practical wisdom and sound judgment; and business and professional experience in fields such as retail,

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that people should receive equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender or race, and are committed to compensating our employees
fairly and equitably. Since at least 2016, Amazon has reported on key workforce demographics, including providing information on its gender pay gap on an annual basis. The reported gender pay statistics demonstrate that Amazon pays its employees
comparably when analyzing the work of people performing the same jobs. When evaluating 2018 compensation in the U.S., our reported data demonstrates that women earned 99.5 cents for every dollar that men earned performing the same jobs, and
minorities earned 98.5 cents for every dollar that white employees earned performing the same jobs. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We also are strongly committed to

work. An unadjusted global median pay statistic does not account for differences in pay practices across countries such as cost of living, job function, level, labor force participation rates, country currency, geography, and other factors that
impact differences in compensation on a global basis. We believe that the global pay gap information that we review and disclose publicly each year, which incorporates these differences, provides a more accurate picture of our global pay policies
and practices. </P>

34.2&nbsp;percent. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Using <I>Formula Swapping</I>, Amazon packs ABSTAIN votes into the formula against shareholder proposals. Ignoring
voter intent, <I>Formula Swapping </I>mathematically converts every abstention into an AGAINST vote, reducing the percentage cast in favor. These distorted figures are then reported by the press, and often become enshrined in company SEC filings.
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Amazon engages in this kind of <I>Formula Swapping</I>, using a favorable Simple Majority vote-counting formula for board elections, but
a more repressive formula to count votes on shareholder proposals. The inconsistent treatment of these management proposals versus shareholder proposals disproportionately benefits management&#146;s board vote while depressing the tally on
shareholder items. This constitutes poor governance&#151;<I>Formula Swapping </I>puts stockholders at a disadvantage, and reflects the faulty logic that a Company can judge voter intent. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">How did this come to be? Under Rule <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">14a-8,</FONT> the SEC mandates use of a fair Simple Majority standard

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Recommendation of the Board of Directors on Item&nbsp;15 </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board regularly reviews our corporate governance practices, including the methodologies for how votes are cast. The Board has undertaken
several steps to improve our governance practices, including adopting proxy access and majority voting for directors. The Board does not, however, believe that the actions requested by the proposal represent a necessary change to our governance
practices. This vote-counting proposal failed at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (with approximately 94% of the shares present at the meeting did not support such proposal) and our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (with approximately 92%
of the shares present at the meeting did not support such proposal). Use of the proponent&#146;s proposed vote-counting methodology would not have changed such outcomes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our vote-counting methodology is consistent with Delaware law, which applies to Amazon by virtue of its incorporation in that state.
Section&nbsp;216 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides, as a default, that in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders. Because shares that vote to abstain are present and entitled to vote, under this Delaware law standard any shares present at the meeting that abstain from voting are
essentially counted as votes against the matter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our vote-counting practices are fair and consistent with practices of peer companies.
The vote-counting methodology we use does not inherently favor proposals submitted by the Board over proposals submitted by shareholders, as the vote-counting standard for approving any proposal other than for the election of directors is identical.
Thus, we apply the same vote counting standard to our own advisory votes on executive compensation, for example, as we do to a shareholder proposal. In addition, the vote-counting methodology we use is the standard applied by a majority of our peers
incorporated in Delaware and, according to a 2013 study by GMI Ratings, by a majority of S&amp;P 500 companies. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Board believes that
changing our vote-counting practices would not be in the best interests of our shareholders. All shares present in person or represented by proxy at our Annual Meeting are entitled to vote on each shareholder proposal included in the Proxy
Statement. The Board believes that it is the responsibility of anyone putting a proposal forward for shareholders to approve&#151;regardless of whether Amazon or a shareholder proponent&#151;to persuade shareholders owning a majority of the shares
that vote to support the proposal. Abstentions reflect the fact that a shareholder has reviewed and evaluated a proposal but has not been persuaded to support the proposal. Further, shareholders are clearly told the effect of an abstaining vote. As
opposed to ignoring shareholders who abstain, we believe it appropriate to count abstentions as present at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote, and thus as relevant in determining whether a majority of the shares present have voted in favor of a
proposal. The effect of changing our vote-counting methodology to completely remove abstentions from the results of a vote would be to disenfranchise those voters who chose to abstain from voting. It would remove one of the voter&#146;s three
options, as a vote to abstain, itself, is a position taken by a shareholder and is an opinion expressed to the Board. </P>

been determinative in any of the proposals voted on by our shareholders since we went public in 1997. Over that time, if the proponent&#146;s proposed vote-counting methodology had been used, it would never have increased the voting results for a
proposal by more than 4%, and would never have resulted in a different outcome in terms of whether a proposal passed or failed. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Compensation Discussion and Analysis </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Compensation Philosophy.</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the Company&#146;s 1997 letter to shareholders, we believe that a
fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. As a result, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. For example, under our compensation philosophy, we have
prioritized stock-based compensation that vests over an extended period of time. In addition, we believe granting stock-based compensation to employees results in motivated, customer-centric people who think and act like owners because they are
owners. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Our compensation philosophy for our &#147;named executive officers&#148; identified in the &#147;Summary Compensation Table&#148;
below is generally the same as for all of our employees who receive equity compensation and is governed by the following principles. First, our compensation program is designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees by providing above
industry-average compensation assuming stock price performance.&nbsp;Second, our compensation program provides strong long-term incentives to align our employees&#146; interests with our shareholders&#146; interests. Third, our compensation program
emphasizes performance and potential to contribute to our long-term success as a basis for compensation increases, as opposed to rewarding solely for length of service.&nbsp;Finally, our compensation program reinforces and reflects our core values,
including customer obsession, innovation, bias for action, acting like owners and thinking long term, a high hiring bar, and frugality. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For our named executive officers, who are employed on an <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">at-will</FONT> basis, we provide few perquisites and
generally do not provide cash bonuses other than in a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">new-hire</FONT> context. We do not maintain nonqualified deferred compensation plans, supplemental executive retirement plan benefits, cash severance programs, or
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">change-in-control</FONT></FONT> benefits for our executive officers. Additionally, except as noted below in certain circumstances, we do not provide cash or equity incentives tied to
performance criteria, which could cause employees to focus solely on short-term returns at the expense of long-term growth and innovation. We believe that investing in the creation of long-term value, without the use of performance measures or
specific indices, is optimal for Amazon employees, particularly at the executive level, and for shareholders. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We believe that the best
measure of our performance is how we are valued over the long term. To help align our executives with long-term value creation, we compensate them with restricted stock unit awards that have long vesting periods. Over time, executives will have
multiple restricted stock unit awards that vest over many years, and thus provide a greater amount of potential compensation in later years than the current year. This encourages them to seek out, develop, and pursue initiatives that focus on
serving our customers and reflect a long-term view for thinking about our operations holistically and contributing to initiatives across the Company. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Because of our executives&#146; low salaries, the absence of an annual bonus program, and reliance on restricted stock units with long vesting
periods, we believe that our executives&#146; compensation is tightly aligned with our shareholders&#146; long-term interests, and therefore that performance conditions on our stock awards are neither necessary nor, given the nature of our business,
appropriate. As a company that relentlessly pursues invention across a wide range of opportunities, we believe it would be inappropriate to utilize a few discrete or short term financial or operational performance measures that may narrowly focus
our executives on the success of only isolated initiatives, instead of on the long-term success of the Company as a whole. For example, in 1997, we could have adopted performance measures appropriate for an Internet bookseller, but those performance
measures may have discouraged our employees from investing their time and energy into initiatives that later became AWS, Kindle, and Alexa. Other examples of long-term focus include the development of our third-party seller business, which was aided
by the lessons learned from our unsuccessful efforts to build an auctions marketplace, and when we experimented with adding services other than fast shipping to our Prime membership program. A performance goal assumes some level of success by a
prescribed measure, but to have a culture that relentlessly pursues invention, we have to encourage experimentation and long-term thinking, which, by definition, means we do not know in advance whether it will work. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, given the unique nature of Amazon and our many initiatives, standardized industry indices are either too broad or too narrow to
serve as relevant comparisons for benchmarking performance. For example, if we </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">
had tied compensation to our performance relative to a retail index, we might never have pursued our AWS business since executives would have been penalized for making the early investments in
cloud technology and infrastructure that AWS required. Similarly, if we tied compensation to our performance relative to a technology index, we might not have built our own devices, developed our own movies and TV shows, or innovated shipping and
delivery methods. A customized index locks in a business profile at a point in time and may deter employees from considering or pursuing initiatives that do not fit into that mold. Thus, we think the best stock market comparison we can make is
measuring our own success: can we continue to grow our share value over the long term? </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As a result, we believe the best performance
measure for our company is stock price performance over the long term. Therefore, when we set our executives&#146; target compensation, we assume a fixed annual increase in the stock price so that our executives&#146; compensation will be negatively
impacted if our stock price is flat or declines, and is favorably impacted if the stock performs beyond the initial stock price assumption. This approach has served our employees and shareholders well over the past three years, as our stock price
has increased approximately 136% between January 2016 and December 2018. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Base Salaries</I>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with our
philosophy that total compensation should be tied to long-term shareholder value, base salaries for named executive officers are designed to provide a minimum level of cash compensation and to be significantly less than those paid to senior
leadership at similarly situated companies. Base salaries ranged from $81,840 for Mr.&nbsp;Bezos to $175,000 for Messrs.&nbsp;Blackburn, Jassy, and Wilke. Due to Mr.&nbsp;Bezos&#146; substantial ownership in Amazon, Mr.&nbsp;Bezos requested not to
receive additional compensation and has never received annual cash compensation in excess of his current amount. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Stock-Based
Compensation</I>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary component of a named executive officer&#146;s total compensation is stock-based compensation in order to closely tie total compensation to long-term shareholder value. Accordingly, named executive
officers receive sizeable stock-based awards at the time of hire and are also eligible for stock-based awards on a periodic basis. Because our compensation program is designed to reward long-term performance and operate over a period of years, named
executive officers may not necessarily receive stock-based awards every year. For example, because annual total compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table below includes the entire fair value as of the grant date of a stock award
granted in that year, without regard to the fact that the grant vests over a number of years, a named executive officer&#146;s total compensation as reported will be higher in years in which he or she receives a grant compared to years in which he
or she does not receive a grant. Due to Mr.&nbsp;Bezos&#146; substantial stock ownership, he believes he is appropriately incentivized and his interests are appropriately aligned with shareholders&#146; interests. Mr.&nbsp;Bezos has never received
any stock-based compensation from Amazon. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Since late 2002, we have used restricted stock units as our primary stock-based compensation
vehicle. We believe that restricted stock units align the long-term interests of named executive officers and shareholders and help efficiently manage overall shareholder dilution from stock awards. Restricted stock unit grant amounts and vesting
for named executive officers, whether for new hire or subsequent grants, are established by the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee after receiving recommendations from the Senior Vice President of Human Resources and the Chief
Executive Officer. These restricted stock unit grants generally vest over a period of five or six years. Vesting does not accelerate as a result of termination of employment or upon a
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">change-in-control</FONT></FONT> (unless the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee determines that the acquiring company will not be assuming or substituting the awards).
</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For new hire grants and grants made in connection with internal promotions, the Senior Vice President of Human Resources, the Chief
Executive Officer, and the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee consider a variety of factors, including past compensation from the named executive officer&#146;s former employer, future compensation from such former employer that will
be forfeited upon joining the Company, the compensation of similarly situated senior executives at Amazon, the named executive officer&#146;s expected level of responsibility and expected contributions to our future success, and the compensation of
similarly situated executives at other retail, Internet, and technology companies. </P>

Officer, and the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee consider a variety of factors, including the named executive officer&#146;s level of responsibility, past contributions to our performance, including our core values, and expected
contributions to our future success, as well as the compensation of similarly situated executives at other retail, Internet, and technology companies. Generally, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee considers whether to make
periodic grants to executive officers in connection with our annual performance and compensation review process, which normally occurs between January and April. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For both new hire and periodic restricted stock unit grants, the Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Chief Executive Officer develop
grant recommendations by subjectively evaluating the factors above to set a total compensation target for each named executive officer and then designing restricted stock unit grants to help meet those total compensation targets based on stock price
appreciation assumptions, taking into account the named executive officer&#146;s cash compensation and the estimated value of <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pre-existing</FONT> stock-based compensation vesting in subsequent years, if any. In this
process, the Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Chief Executive Officer view projected total compensation for a given year as cash compensation expected to be earned in that year plus an assumed value of stock-based compensation vesting in
that year. Because we focus on total compensation over time and take into account existing compensation, periodic grants for a smaller number of shares do not necessarily reflect lower total compensation. </P>

Analysis when evaluating our executive compensation and compensation policies and practices. While each of these factors informed the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee&#146;s decisions regarding our executive compensation program,
the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee did not implement changes to our executive compensation program as a result of the shareholder advisory votes. </P>

For 2018, the median annual total compensation for all U.S. full-time Amazon employees was $35,096, which reflects two months of our $15 per hour minimum wage in the U.S. that went into effect on
November&nbsp;1, 2018. We provide numerous benefits to our employees, including comprehensive medical benefits from day one, 401(k) matching contributions, generous parental leave for both parents (birth mothers are eligible for up to 20 weeks of
leave and partners up to six), and access to Career Choice, a program under which we pay up to 95% of tuition and fees (up to a yearly maximum) towards a certificate or diploma in qualified fields of study. For our 2018 ratio, we used a median
compensated employee identified pursuant to our 2017 identification process, as we believe the changes to our employee population and compensation have not significantly impacted our ratio. For purposes of identifying our 2017 median compensated
employee, we took into account salary, bonus, and grant date fair value of RSUs granted during 2017 for all our employees as of December&nbsp;31, 2017. We annualized this compensation for employees who did not work the entire year, except for
