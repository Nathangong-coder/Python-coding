<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Compaq Computer Corporation
will hold its 2001 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Thursday, April 26, 2001,
at 10:00 A.M., at the Exhibit Hall in the J.W. Marriott Hotel, 5150 Westheimer
Road, Houston, Texas 77056. At the 2001 Annual Meeting, shareholders will (1)
elect eight Compaq directors for one-year terms, (2) vote to approve the Compaq
Computer Corporation 2001 Stock Option Plan, and (3) vote on such other matters,
including a shareholder proposal, as may properly come before the meeting. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>You may vote in any one of
four ways: in person by attending the 2001 Annual Meeting, by telephone, by the Internet,
or by mail using the enclosed proxy card. Specific voting information is included under the caption
&#147;Voting Procedures.&#148; Shareholders of record at the close of business
on February 28, 2001 are entitled to vote. On that day, approximately 1.7
billion shares of Compaq Common Stock were outstanding. Each share entitles the
holder to one vote. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Compaq Board of
Directors asks you to vote in favor of the director nominees and the Compaq

you to vote against the shareholder proposal concerning director nominees. This
Proxy Statement provides you with detailed information about each of these
matters. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We encourage you to read
this Proxy Statement carefully. In addition, you may obtain information about
Compaq from the Annual Report to Shareholders included with this notice and from
documents that we have filed with the SEC. </FONT></P>

additional copies of these materials, please contact your broker. If you receive
multiple copies and would prefer to receive only one, please contact your broker
as well. Compaq does not currently use householding for record holders and will

the opportunity to continue to receive multiple copies in the same household. </FONT></P>

Procedures</FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Your vote is important.
Because many shareholders cannot personally attend the 2001 Annual Meeting, it
is necessary that a large number be represented by proxy. If you are a
shareholder of record, you may vote in any of the following four ways: (1) by
attending the 2001 Annual Meeting, (2) by calling the toll-free telephone number
listed on the proxy card, (3) by voting on the Internet at the address listed on
the proxy card, or (4) by marking, signing, dating and mailing your proxy card
in the postage-paid envelope provided. You may revoke your proxy at any time
before it is actually voted at the 2001 Annual Meeting by (1) delivering a
written notice of revocation to the Secretary of Compaq, (2) submitting a
later-dated proxy, or (3) attending the 2001 Annual Meeting and withdrawing the
proxy. You may also be represented by another person present at the 2001 Annual
Meeting by executing a proxy designating such person to act on your behalf. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>If you are a shareholder of
record, you can save Compaq expense by voting by telephone or on the Internet.
The telephone and Internet voting procedures use a control number to
authenticate shareholders of record, and allow you to vote your shares and
confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. You can save Compaq
additional expense by following the instructions on the proxy card to receive
future proxy statements and annual reports electronically. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>If your shares are held in
the name of a bank or broker, you will be able to vote by telephone or on the
Internet by following the instructions on the proxy form you receive from your
bank or broker. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>You have three choices when
you vote for directors. You may (1) vote for all the director nominees as a
group, (2) withhold your vote for all of the director nominees as a group, or
(3) vote for all director nominees as a group except those nominees you
identify. If you sign, date and mail your proxy card without indicating how you
want to vote, your vote will be counted as a vote in favor of all the nominees,
in favor of the 2001 Stock Option Plan, and against the shareholder proposal. If
you do not vote in one of the four ways, you will not be counted as present for
determining the existence of a quorum. However, if you do not vote personally
prior to the 2001 Annual Meeting and your shares are held by your broker in
street name, your broker may vote your shares in the election of directors. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>We encourage you to vote
and to vote promptly. Voting promptly may save Compaq the expense of a second
mailing. </FONT></P>

the approval of stock option plans by shareholders and to permit shareholders to exercise
more effective oversight of Compaq&#146;s equity programs. No grants to directors under

Proxy Statement. In addition to the grants shown in that table, in 2000, 2.5
million stock options were granted to other executive officers as a group and
approximately 114.2 million options were granted to all other employees.
Compaq&#146;s 1998 Stock Option Plan and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors also provide for grants to non-employee directors. Grants
to directors are more fully described below under the caption

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Participants generally have
tax consequences associated with stock option grants. In the U.S., no taxable
income is recognized by the optionee at the time a nonqualified stock option is
granted. Generally, on the date of exercise of a nonqualified stock option,
ordinary income is recognized by the optionee in an amount equal to the
difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares on
the date of exercise, and Compaq receives a tax deduction for the same amount.
The 2001 Plan has been designed to meet the requirements in Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which means that these amounts
will be deductible for grants to executive officers. Upon disposition of the
shares acquired, an optionee generally recognizes the appreciation or
depreciation on the shares after the date of exercise as either short-term or
long-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the shares have been held.
Compaq has no current plans to grant stock appreciation rights or incentive
stock options to U.S. employees and has not made such grants to date (other than
the continuation of incentive stock option status for options assumed in certain
mergers). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Bartlett Naylor of 1255 N. Buchanan,
Arlington, Va., 22205, owner of at least $2,000 of Compaq common stock, has indicated
that he will introduce the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Resolved: The shareholders
urge our board of directors to take the necessary steps to nominate at least two
candidates for each open board position, and that the names, biographical
sketches, SEC-required declarations and photographs of such candidates shall
appear in the company&#146;s proxy materials (or other required disclosures) to
the same extent that such information is required by law and is our
company&#146;s current practice with the single candidates it now proposes for
each position. </FONT></P>

Statement in Support of the Resolution:</FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Although our company&#146;s
board appreciates the importance of qualified people overseeing management, we
believe that the process for electing directors can be improved. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Our company currently
nominates for election only one candidate for each board seat, thus leaving
shareholders no practical choice in most director elections. Shareholders who
oppose a candidate have no easy way to do so unless they are willing to
undertake the considerable expense of running an independent candidate for the
board. The only other way to register dissent about a given candidate is to
withhold support for that nominee, but that process rarely affects the outcome
of director elections. The current system thus provides no readily effective way
for shareholders to oppose a candidate that has failed to attend board meetings;
or serves on so many boards as to be unable to supervise our company management
diligently; or who serves as a consultant to the company that could compromise
independence; or poses other problems. As a result, while directors legally
serve as the shareholder agent in overseeing management, the election of
directors at the annual meeting is largely perfunctory. Even directors of near
bankrupt companies enjoy re-election with 90%+ pluralities. The &#147;real&#148;
selection comes through the nominating committee, a process too often
influenced, if not controlled, by the very management the board is expected to
scrutinize critically. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Our company should offer a
rational choice when shareholders elect directors. Such a process could abate
the problem of a chair &#147;choosing&#148; his own board, that is, selecting
those directors he expects will reflexively support his initiatives, and
shedding those who may sometimes dissent. Such a process could create healthy
and more rigorous shareholder evaluation about which specific nominees are best
qualified. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Would such a process lead to board
discontinuity? Perhaps, but only with shareholder approval. Presumably an incumbent would
be defeated only because shareholders considered the alternative a superior choice. Would
such a procedure discourage some candidates? Surely our board should not be made of those
intolerant of competition. Would such a procedure be &#147;awkward&#148; for management
when it recruits candidates? Hopefully so. (Management  </FONT></P>

Board of Directors Opposes This Resolution:</FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Compaq&#146;s Board of
Directors believes that it has a duty to provide Compaq shareholders with a
slate of director candidates whom the Board of Directors believe, in their best
judgment, to be the most qualified and who are ready, willing and able to manage
the affairs of Compaq. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Board of Directors
views the current nominating process to be the best means of ensuring that
individuals with appropriate qualifications serve as directors. The Corporate
Governance Committee, which consists solely of outside directors, serves a
critical function by reviewing numerous candidates and selecting only those
nominees possessing the highest quality and skills necessary and appropriate for
service on the Board. In selecting a slate of candidates each year, the Board
and the Corporate Governance Committee carefully consider the performance and
qualifications not just of each individual but of the group as a whole, and the
Board nominates the persons that they believe together will best serve
Compaq&#146;s shareholders. In this manner, the composition of the Board of
Directors will remain diverse and balanced in its experience and expertise. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Board believes that if
they followed the procedure set forth in the proposal and nominated twice as
many candidates to the Board as there are seats, they would fail in their duty
to Compaq&#146;s shareholders to identify and recommend the best candidates. As
the individuals responsible for advising shareholders in making voting
decisions, they have an obligation to inform shareholders which candidates they
favor. Many well-qualified persons would not be willing to participate in the
type of contested election that the proposal would produce, particularly if the
Board did not recommend them. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The procedure set forth by
the proposal would not be an efficient or effective means of selecting the best
directors to represent Compaq&#146;s shareholders. Shareholders are protected in
several ways under Compaq&#146;s current method. First, in making their
selections, the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board evaluate the
performance of the Board of Directors and individual directors as well as
identifying potential new members. Second, the federal securities laws require
that all companies include in their proxy material certain information about
each candidate that the Securities and Exchange Commission has determined is
necessary for a shareholder&#146;s informed vote. Finally, in situations the
proposal contemplates, dissatisfied shareholders may register their disapproval
by withholding votes for some or all nominees or by conducting a proxy contest
to challenge the Board&#146;s candidates. The current process allows for
alternative candidates to be proposed by shareholders on a timely basis.
Appropriate information about such candidates can be distributed in a mailing
from the shareholder making the nomination, or at management&#146;s discretion,
can be included in Compaq&#146;s proxy materials. </FONT></P>

has been serving more than one year receives an annual option grant for 25,000

which the number of shares and the exercise price are based upon 50% of the
closing price of the Common Stock on the day of the annual meeting. The exercise
price of the annual stock option grants in 2000 was $30 per share, and the price

connection with his being named Chairman of the Board of Directors, Compaq granted Mr.
Capellas 970,000 shares of restricted common stock. This restricted stock vests as
follows: 500,000 shares vest only upon attainment of certain performance objectives
(250,000 based upon attainment of stock price targets and 250,000 based upon relative
earnings per share (&#147;EPS&#148;) growth over three consecutive four-quarter
performance periods, the first of which ends in third quarter 2001); 300,000 vest in
increments of 100,000 each on November 1, 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively; and 170,000
shares vested thirty days from the date of the grant. The restricted stock granted to Mr.
Capellas in 1999 vests on the fifth anniversary of his election if he is then an employee
of Compaq, subject to earlier vesting as follows: 50,000 of such shares vest if the price
of Compaq&#146;s Common Stock is at least $35 per share for thirty consecutive trading
days, 50,000 of such shares vest if such price is at least $40 per share, and 100,000 of
such shares vest if such price is at least $50 per share. The restricted stock granted to
the other named officers was granted on May 15, 2000, and vests based on the attainment
of performance objectives approved by the Committee (for 2000, quarterly EPS targets were
used), with full vesting in May 2004 if the shares have not vested previously as a result
of performance. No dividends are paid on unvested shares of this restricted stock. The
dollar value of restricted stock reported in the table was calculated by multiplying the
number of shares awarded by the closing price on the date of the grants, which was
$27.38. The dollar value of restricted stock held by each executive officer as of
December 31, 2000 is as follows, based on $15.05 per share, the closing price of Compaq&#146;s
Common Stock on December 29, 2000: </FONT></TD>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Compaq entered into a new
employment agreement with Mr. Capellas in October 2000 after his appointment as
Chairman of the Board. Under this employment agreement, which has a three-year
initial term and is renewable annually thereafter, Mr. Capellas receives an
annual base salary of no less than $1.6 million and is eligible for a target
annual cash bonus of two times his base salary. The actual amount of any such
cash bonus will be based on performance. Mr. Capellas is also eligible for
long-term incentives, including stock options and other performance-based
rewards, on the same basis as other executive officers. The total target value
of Mr. Capellas&#146; long-term incentive opportunity, on an annual basis, is
seven to ten times his base salary. </FONT></P>



<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As part of the new
employment agreement, Mr. Capellas was granted 970,000 shares of restricted
stock under Compaq&#146;s 1989 Equity Incentive Plan. This restricted stock
vests partially over time and partially based only on performance. More
specifically, 170,000 shares vested thirty days from the date of the grant, and
another 300,000 shares will vest in increments of 100,000 each on November 1,
2001, November 1, 2002, and November 1, 2003. The remaining 500,000 shares will
vest only upon attainment of certain performance objectives. Of those 500,000
shares, 250,000 will vest based on Compaq&#146;s stock performance. The other
250,000 shares will vest based on relative growth in EPS (compared to the
average growth in EPS for IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Dell) over three
four-quarter performance periods. If the performance objectives are not met in
the periods allowed (by November 1, 2004 for stock price targets and through
third quarter of 2003 for relative growth in EPS), Mr. Capellas will no longer
be eligible to vest in these shares. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The 2000 employment
agreement also provides that Compaq will forgive, over a three-year retention
period, a $5 million loan made to Mr. Capellas under his original employment
agreement, which was used to purchase Compaq stock. The first third of the
balance of the loan will be forgiven on November 1, 2001, with half of the
then-remaining balance being forgiven on November 1, 2002 and the final balance
on November 1, 2003. The agreement provides for payment of a special one-time
cash bonus of $850,000 and a tax-assistance loan, at market interest rates, of
$2.5 million to help defray the immediate tax impact of the future loan
forgiveness and partial vesting of the restricted stock. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Mr. Capellas will be
eligible for severance benefits, including separation payments totaling three
times his annual base salary, under certain qualifying circumstances. In
particular, Mr. Capellas will be deemed to have incurred a Qualifying
Termination entitling him to severance benefits if his employment is terminated
without cause, if he resigns for Good Reason (which includes removal from the
position of Chief Executive Officer, removal from/failure to be elected Chairman
of the Board, assignment of duties inconsistent with his position, receipt of a
notice of non-renewal of his employment agreement, or a material reduction in
total target compensation that is not part of an across-the-board reduction for
other executive officers), or if his employment is involuntarily terminated for
any reason within 180 days of a change in control. In the event of a Qualifying
Termination, the agreement also provides for accelerated or continued vesting in
certain portions of the restricted stock granted to Mr. Capellas under both the
2000 and original employment agreements, continued vesting in outstanding stock
options over the separation pay period (which is 24 months following
termination), payment of a pro-rated annual incentive, and accelerated
forgiveness of the 1999 loan. If Mr. Capellas separates from employment with
Compaq as a result of death or disability, he will receive a severance payment
of 1.5 times the sum of his base annual salary and his target annual bonus,
among other severance benefits. </FONT></P>

Resources Committee Report</FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Human Resources
Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed of independent directors,
ensures that Compaq&#146;s human resource and compensation policies support and
enhance its strategic objectives. The Committee reviews and advises the Board
about Compaq&#146;s human resource strategies, oversees executive succession
planning, adopts the policies that govern Compaq&#146;s compensation programs,
sets the compensation of executive officers, and administers Compaq&#146;s cash
bonus and stock equity plans. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Executive Succession
Planning.</B> The Committee believes that succession planning plays a vital role
in a healthy corporate environment. In 2000 Compaq made significant strides in
the area of succession planning and attaining goals and objectives set by the
Committee. Compaq is well on the way to developing a comprehensive succession
plan that reaches deeply into the organization and ensures that internal talent
is recognized, developed, and effectively utilized &#151; all to the benefit of
Compaq and its shareholders. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Compaq&#146;s
Compensation Programs.</B> The Committee establishes compensation programs
designed to attract, retain, and reward executives who will lead Compaq in
achieving its business goals in a highly competitive and rapidly changing
industry and ensures that management compensation is reasonable in light of
Compaq&#146;s objectives, performance, and compensation for similar personnel at
other companies. In 2000 the compensation mix for executive officers consisted
of base salaries, bonuses, restricted stock and stock option awards. As a
result, much of an officer&#146;s compensation depends on Compaq&#146;s
financial performance and shareholder return. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Comparative compensation
data in 2000 was derived from an analysis of independent surveys of compensation
practices by Compaq and external consultants. Information from the computer and
electronics industry segments is used wherever available. The Committee believes
these sources provide accurate information to evaluate the pay practices of the
companies with which Compaq competes to hire and retain executives. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Executive Officer
Compensation.</B> Compaq targets executive base salary ranges at the 50th to
75th percentile of relevant market data. The Committee annually establishes each
executive officer&#146;s overall targeted compensation (base salary, cash
incentives, and equity interests and other long-term incentives), including the
Chief Executive Officer&#146;s, based on its evaluation of the officer&#146;s
performance and contribution in the previous year and on competitive pay
practices. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Since accepting the
position of CEO in 1999, Mr. Capellas has consistently demonstrated his ability
to lead Compaq, keeping the company on course in the face of the challenges and
opportunities presented in this competitive industry. In light of his success,
Mr. Capellas was elected Chairman of the Board in September of 2000, and, based
on an analysis of market data for similarly situated executives, the Committee
approved a new employment agreement for Mr. Capellas. In the Committee&#146;s
view, it was in the best interest of Compaq to ensure that Mr. Capellas
continues his valuable contributions, and the new employment agreement was an
important step in achieving that goal. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The 2000 employment
agreement has an initial three-year term and is renewable on an annual basis
thereafter. Under the 2000 agreement, Mr. Capellas receives an annual salary and
is eligible for an annual cash bonus and long-term incentives (including stock
options). Mr. Capellas also received restricted stock (including shares that
vest solely upon attainment of certain performance goals with respect to stock
price and relative EPS growth as well as shares that vest over time) and a
special one-time cash bonus. The Committee agreed that the loan made to Mr.
Capellas in connection with his prior employment agreement (to allow him to
purchase Compaq stock) will be forgiven over a three-year retention period, with
the first third to be forgiven in November of 2001. Because this agreement
caused Mr. Capellas to have imputed income in 2000 with respect to the amount of
this loan, Mr. Capellas also received a tax assistance loan. According to the
market analysis prepared by outside compensation consultants, Mr. Capellas&#146;
total compensation package, including compensation provided for under his new
employment agreement, places him at the 65th percentile compared to individuals
holding the same positions for relevant comparator companies. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Likewise, the Committee
reviewed market data, Compaq&#146;s historical compensation practices and
personal compensation history in determining compensation packages for other
newly appointed executive officers. In order to ensure stability of the company
through retention of executive officers, the Committee approved new severance
agreements for the executive officers in October. These agreements will be
implemented in 2001 and provide for severance benefits in the event of certain
qualifying terminations, including termination without cause, involuntary
separation within 180 days of a change in control, and resignation for good
reason (such as for a material reduction in responsibilities). </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Cash Incentive Plan.</B>
In 2000, the Committee evaluated comparative compensation data to determine
bonus targets that would result in average total cash compensation to executives
between the 50th percentile and 75th percentile level of the market if goals
were met. In 2000, Compaq implemented a balanced scorecard approach for
evaluating the performance of the senior executive team, including executive
officers, and bonus payments for executive officers were linked to their results
relative to balanced scorecards established in the first quarter of the year.
The balanced scorecard for executive officers focuses on financial performance,
customer satisfaction, operational objectives, and people management. In
addition, the Committee reviews ranges of awards appropriate for different
management levels based on competitive pay practices. It then delegates to the
Chief Executive Officer the authority to determine bonus awards for employees
other than executive officers based on individual performance and contributions. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In establishing Mr.
Capellas&#146; bonus, the Committee considered Mr. Capellas&#146; performance in
2000, focusing on the objectives set forth in his balanced scorecard. The
Committee determined that Mr. Capellas performed effectively against his goals
overall, bringing Compaq forward significantly in the areas of customer
satisfaction and people management in particular. The Committee noted the
strength of Mr. Capellas&#146; leadership as demonstrated by the rapidity with
which he led Compaq&#146;s senior management team to develop and deploy a
vision, mission, and strategy to focus Compaq on leadership in information
technology and solutions. The Committee determined that despite market
volatility in 2000, Mr. Capellas&#146; leadership has continued to have a
positive impact on customer and employee satisfaction, the establishment of
successful strategic partnerships and the investment community&#146;s confidence
in Compaq. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Stock Equity Plans.</B>The Human
Resources Committee and the Board of Directors believe that management&#146;s ownership
of a significant equity interest in Compaq is an important incentive in building
shareholder wealth and aligning the long-term interests of management and shareholders.
Therefore, the Committee grants stock options at option prices not less than the fair
market value of Compaq common stock on the grant date; as a result, stock options have no
value unless the share price increases over the fair market value on the date of grant.

since executives realize the benefits of options only as they vest based on tenure after
the grant. The Committee uses competitive market data, historical option grant practices,
and the projected value of outstanding unvested shares and proposed awards to determine
an appropriate range of awards for executive officers. The Committee establishes ranges
for awards to other key employees based upon level and contribution and delegates to the
Chief Executive Officer the authority to make stock option awards to these employees. The
Committee made a special grant to certain key executives on May 15, 2000, at an option
price of $27.38, and annual grants to executive officers and key employees on December
13, 2000, at an option price of $18.10.  </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Competition for key talent
in the technology industry was particularly intense in 2000. Compaq, in keeping
with industry trends, granted a substantial number of stock options. In order to
continue to keep pace with competitive practices, Compaq is asking its
shareholders to approve a new stock option plan and additional shares for use in
granting employees stock options. This aspect of employee compensation, which so
closely aligns individual financial success with company performance, is
critical to attracting and retaining employees, particularly in technology
companies, and this Committee recommended to the Board the adoption of the new
plan. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On May 15, 2000, the
Committee approved a grant of restricted stock to a limited number of key
executives in order to strengthen the link between company performance and
rewards. Market data indicates an increasing trend toward the use of restricted
stock, and the Committee believed that the grant would aid in critical retention
efforts. Executives who received a grant have the opportunity to vest quarterly
based on performance measures established by the Board and Mr. Capellas. In
2000, quarterly EPS targets were used as the performance measure, and on
December 13, 2000, the Committee approved the use of quarterly EPS targets as
the performance measure for 2001. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Human Resources
Committee also monitors compliance with the Executive Stock Ownership Policy.
The Executive Stock Ownership Policy requires the Chief Executive Officer to own
250,000 shares and requires each of the other executive officers to own 10,000
shares for each year as an executive officer. New executive officers have three
years to meet this goal. Mr. Capellas&#146; stock ownership meets the
requirement and all other executive officers either meet or are making
satisfactory progress toward their ownership goals. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush 10" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Compaq is subject to
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), which could limit the deductibility of
certain compensation payments to its executive officers. Compaq generally
intends to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m); however, it also
weighs the burdens of such compliance against the benefits to be obtained by
Compaq, and pays compensation that is not fully deductible if it determines that
such payments are in Compaq&#146;s best interests. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The following graph compares Compaq&#146;s
cumulative total shareholder return to the S&amp;P 500 Index and the S&amp;P Computers
(Hardware) Index over a five-year period, beginning December 31, 1995, and ending
December 31, 2000. The total shareholder return assumes $100 invested at the beginning of
the period in Compaq Common Stock, the S&amp;P Computers (Hardware) Index, and the S&amp;P
500 Index. It also assumes reinvestment of all dividends. Past financial performance
should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors
should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.  </FONT></P>

in ownership of Compaq&#146;s Common Stock. Compaq believes that during the

complied with all these filing requirements. In making this statement, Compaq
has relied solely on a review of copies of reports filed under Section 16(a)
