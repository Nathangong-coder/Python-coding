by logging in with the 16-digit control number found in the box marked by the arrow for postal mail recipients of the Notice of

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Dear Fellow
Stockholders, As I am writing this, our world is gripped by the COVID-19 global pandemic. There&rsquo;s a lot of uncertainty about
what our lives will look like when this is all over, which is scary for everyone. That&rsquo;s why I find it especially important
to find opportunities for optimism, and we should all take pride that Alphabet&rsquo;s response to this crisis has been a source
of support and hope for people around the globe. Your company has rallied to help people in numerous ways. Google&rsquo;s services
are keeping people informed and connected; GSuite and Chromebooks are helping adults to work and children to learn; the company
has major efforts to support small businesses and nonprofits; it is helping people looking for accurate and trustworthy answers
to their questions. Beyond this, we&rsquo;re investing in mask production to help health care workers on the front lines, and Verily
has been rolling out a testing service in the Bay Area and beyond. We&rsquo;re particularly focused on actively supporting our
own workforce in this difficult time, including our extended workforce and caregivers &ndash; like parents who need more flexible
working arrangements at this time. All told, it&rsquo;s been truly inspiring to watch our company step up to meet a historically
great challenge with the ingenuity, integrity and creative problem-solving we were built on. Our response has been driven and overseen
by the Google and Alphabet CEO, Sundar. This past year, Larry and Sergey left their posts as leaders of Alphabet and the Board
appointed Sundar to lead us into the future (Larry and Sergey remain involved as founders and Board members). Obviously, we all
owe a huge debt of gratitude to Larry and Sergey for building this company with the vision and inventiveness that made us what
we are today, 22 years after it all started. I am also very excited to see where Sundar takes us going forward. The Alphabet structure
allows us to have a portfolio of different businesses with different time horizons, while also allowing us to set up independent
companies that can raise money from outside investors, which Other Bets like Waymo and Verily have successfully done. As our company
builds technologies that improve the lives of people everywhere, the Board continues our commitment to making sure everything we
do is ethical, fair, and responsible, serving the best interests of our users, employees, and stockholders at all times. Over the
past year, the Board has overseen the company&rsquo;s initiatives in a number of important areas: Ethical use of technology: The
benefits of technological progress lately have come with some negative unintended side effects, generating questions about the
ethics and responsibilities of those of us working in this industry. We&rsquo;ve dedicated ourselves to doing what we can to mitigate
some of the consequences of bad actors using technology for harmful ends. For example, we have strengthened YouTube&rsquo;s content
policies, leading to more removals of hate speech, supremacist content, while also elevating authoritative sources. We have given
people improved ways to control and remove their data when they use Google&rsquo;s services. Our AI Principles were created to
guide the ethical use of AI, helping to ensure that AI technology is deployed in a manner that is safe, accountable, minimizes
bias, and generates societal benefit. In one case, we&rsquo;ve collaborated with independent experts using the UN&rsquo;s Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights as a framework, to assess new products&rsquo; potential impact on human rights.</P>

</div>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">&bull;Improving our workplace: We&rsquo;re constantly working to
ensure our employees are treated fairly, compensated equitably, and that substantiated claims of misconduct are dealt with firmly.
Over the last year, Google eliminated the requirement of arbitration for employment claims, giving claimants broader leeway in
how they bring about their complaints. Our latest pay-equity report included the highest-ever percentage of Googlers (93%) and
led to more than $5 million in pay adjustments. We continue to build on our commitment to hire, retain, and equitably compensate
the most diverse and inclusive workforce possible. &bull;Championing sustainability: We are focused on sustainability across all
of our products and services. We&rsquo;ve been a carbon-neutral company since 2007, and in 2019, we made the largest corporate
purchase of renewable energy in the world. Compared with five years ago, our data centers now deliver around seven times as much
computing power with the same amount of electrical power, and we're applying machine learning to drive energy efficiency even further.
We also implemented a program that offsets the carbon emissions from shipping for any product you buy on Google Shopping or any
Made by Google hardware. This is by no means an exhaustive list; they&rsquo;re just some of the ways we are creating an Alphabet
built with transparency, care, and integrity, as top priorities. As a Board, we realize that you have placed your trust in us to
help lead Alphabet into the future, and to do so in a way that makes you proud not just of what we do, but how we do it. We cherish
that trust, and look forward to working with you to make sure we&rsquo;re all building the best possible company, together. On
behalf of the Board of Directors, we look forward to working with you, and serving you, in the years to come. Thank you for your
support and feedback. Very truly yours, JOHN L. HENNESSY CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">&mdash;&mdash;CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS We have
adopted a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers (including our principal executive officer, principal financial
officer, and principal accounting officer), and employees, known as the Alphabet Code of Conduct. We have also adopted Corporate
Governance Guidelines, which, in conjunction with our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and charters of the standing committees
of our Board of Directors, form the framework for our corporate governance. The Alphabet Code of Conduct and Corporate Governance
Guidelines are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at https://abc.xyz/investor/. We will post amendments
to the Alphabet Code of Conduct or any waivers of the Alphabet Code of Conduct for directors and executive officers on the same
website. Stockholders may request printed copies of the Alphabet Code of Conduct, the Corporate Governance Guidelines, and committee
charters at no charge by sending inquiries to: Investor Relations Alphabet Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, California
94043 Email: investor-relations@abc.xyz Board Meetings During 2019, the Board of Directors held ten meetings and acted by unanimous
written/electronic consent twice. Each director attended at least 75% of all Board of Directors and applicable committee meetings,
except for Alan, who attended 73% of all Board of Directors and Audit Committee meetings due to personal extenuating circumstances
of which our Board of Directors was made aware. We encourage our directors to attend our annual meetings of stockholders. Five
directors attended Alphabet&rsquo;s 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Board Leadership Structure In December 2019, Sundar became
the Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet. In January 2018, John L. Hennessy, the then Lead Independent Director, was appointed to
serve as Alphabet&rsquo;s Chairman of the Board. The Board of Directors believes that this leadership structure, which separates
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles, is appropriate at this time in light of the evolution of Alphabet&rsquo;s business
and operating environment. In particular, the Board of Directors believes that this structure clarifies the individual roles and
responsibilities of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, streamlines decision-making, and enhances accountability. John, a long-standing
member of the Board, has in-depth knowledge of the issues, challenges, and opportunities facing us. As such, the Board of Directors
believes that he is best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that the Board of Directors&rsquo; time and attention are focused
on the most critical matters. His role enables decisive leadership, ensures clear accountability, and enhances the ability to communicate
our messages and strategy. Each of the director nominees standing for election, other than Larry, Sergey, and Sundar, is independent
(see &ldquo;Director Independence&rdquo; on page 27 of this proxy statement), and the Board of Directors believes that the independent
directors provide effective oversight of management. Board Committees Our Board of Directors is currently composed of eleven directors.
Our Board of Directors has the following four standing committees: 1. an Audit Committee, 2. a Leadership Development and Compensation
Committee, 3. a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and 4. an Executive Committee. From time to time, the Board of Directors
may also establish ad hoc committees to address particular matters. Each of the standing committees operates under a written charter
adopted by the Board of Directors. All of the current standing committee charters are available on the Investor Relations section
of our website at https://abc.xyz/investor/other/board/. Printed copies of the charters are available at no charge to any stockholder
who requests them by following the instructions above.</P>

set forth under &ldquo;Director Selection Process and Qualifications&rdquo; below. Any stockholder recommendations for consideration
by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee should include the candidate&rsquo;s name, biographical information, information
regarding any relationships between the candidate and the company within the last three years, at least three personal references,
a statement of recommendation of the candidate from the stockholder, a description of our shares beneficially owned by the stockholder,
a description of all arrangements between the candidate and the recommending stockholder and any other person pursuant to which
the candidate is being recommended, a written indication of the candidate&rsquo;s willingness to serve on our Board of Directors,
any other information required to be provided under securities laws and regulations, and a written indication to provide such other
information as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may reasonably request. There are no differences in the manner
in which the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates nominees for director based on whether the nominee is recommended
by a stockholder or otherwise. Stockholder recommendations to our Board of Directors should be sent to us by one of the following
two ways: 1. via mail with a copy via email: 2. via email only: Alphabet Inc. Attn: Corporate Secretary 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses a variety
of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for directors. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly assesses
the appropriate size and composition of the Board of Directors, the needs of the Board of Directors and the respective committees
of the Board of Directors, and the qualifications of candidates in light of these needs. Candidates may come to the attention of
the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee through stockholders, management, current members of the Board of Directors,
or search firms. The evaluation of these candidates may be based solely upon the information provided to the committee or may also
include discussions with persons familiar with the candidate, an interview of the candidate, or other actions the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee deems appropriate, including the use of third parties to review candidates. The Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee may, at Alphabet&rsquo;s expense, retain search firms, consultants, and other advisors to identify, screen,
and/or evaluate candidates. When considering a potential non-incumbent candidate, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
will factor into its determination the following qualities, among others: integrity, professional reputation and strength of character,
educational background, knowledge of our business, diversity of professional experience, including whether the person is a current
or former chief executive officer or chief financial officer of a public company or the head of a division of a large international
organization, and ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders and to provide practical insights and diverse perspectives.
Additionally, due to the global and complex nature of our business, our Board of Directors believes it is important to consider
diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, age, education, cultural background, and professional experiences in evaluating board candidates.
Accordingly, when evaluating candidates for nomination as new directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will
consider, and will ask any search firm that it engages to provide, a set of candidates that includes both underrepresented people
of color and different genders. Candidates also are evaluated in light of our other policies, such as those relating to independence
and service on other boards, as well as considerations relating to the size, structure, and needs of our Board of Directors. As
part of its consideration of director succession, our Board of Directors and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
monitor whether the directors as a group meet the criteria for the composition of the Board of Directors, including overall diversity
of perspective and experience. Our Board of Directors is composed of a diverse group of leaders in their respective fields. Many
of the current directors have senior leadership experience at major domestic and international companies. In these positions, they
have also gained experience in core management skills, such as strategic and financial planning, public company financial reporting,
compliance, risk management, leadership development, and international business experience. Most of our directors also have experience
serving on boards of directors and board committees of other public companies, and have an understanding of corporate governance
practices and trends, different business processes, challenges, and strategies. Other directors have experience as presidents or
trustees of significant academic, research, and philanthropic institutions, which brings unique perspectives to the Board of Directors.
Further, our directors also have other experience that makes them valuable members, such as entrepreneurial experience and experience
developing technology or managing technology companies, which provides insight into strategic and operational issues faced by us.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the above-mentioned attributes, along
with the leadership skills and other experiences of our board members described below, provide us with a diverse range of perspectives

The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee reviews at least annually and recommends to the full Board of Directors plans
for the development, retention, and replacement of executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet. Additionally,
the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board Directors
are jointly responsible for overseeing the risks and exposures associated with management succession planning. Our Board of Directors
believes that the directors and the Chief Executive Officer should collaborate on succession planning and that the entire Board
should be involved in the critical aspects of the management succession planning process, including establishing selection criteria
that reflect our business strategies, identifying and developing internal candidates to ensure the continuity of our culture, and
making key management succession decisions. Management succession is regularly discussed by the directors in board meetings and
in executive sessions of the Board of Directors. Directors become familiar with potential successors for key management positions
through various means, including regular organization and talent reviews, presentations to the Board of Directors, and informal
meetings.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Board&rsquo;s Role in Risk Oversight The Board of Directors,
as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for oversight of risk management. The oversight responsibility of the
Board of Directors and its committees is enabled by management reporting processes, including an annual company-wide risk assessment,
that are designed to provide visibility to the Board of Directors and its committees about the identification, assessment, and
management of critical risks and management&rsquo;s risk mitigation strategies. While the Board of Directors is ultimately responsible
for risk oversight at Alphabet, our Board of Directors has delegated to its committees oversight of risks associated with their
respective areas of responsibility, as summarized below. When appropriate, the committees provide reports to the full Board of
Directors on these and other areas for review. Each committee meets in executive session with key management personnel and representatives
of outside advisors as needed. In particular, the Board of Directors has delegated to the Audit Committee the primary responsibility
for the oversight of many of the risks facing our businesses. The Audit Committee&rsquo;s charter provides that it will review
and discuss with management any major risk exposures, including, among others, the key areas of oversight set forth below, and
the steps Alphabet takes to detect, monitor, and actively manage such exposures. Board/Committee Primary Areas of Risk Oversight
Full Board Strategic, financial, and execution risks and exposures associated with our business strategy, product innovation, sales
roadmap, policy matters, significant litigation and regulatory exposures, and other current matters that may present material risk
to our financial performance, operations, infrastructure, plans, prospects or reputation, acquisitions and divestitures, and data
privacy, including cybersecurity. Audit Committee Risks and exposures associated with financial matters, particularly financial
reporting, tax, accounting, disclosure, internal control over financial reporting, investment guidelines and credit and liquidity
matters, our programs and policies relating to legal compliance and strategy, merger and acquisition activities, and our operational
infrastructure, particularly reliability, business continuity, capacity, security, and data privacy, including cybersecurity. Leadership
Development and Compensation Committee Risks and exposures associated with leadership assessment, management succession planning,
and the operation and structure of executive compensation programs and arrangements, including incentive plans. Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee Risks and exposures associated with director and management succession planning, corporate governance,
and overall board effectiveness. Executive Sessions Executive sessions of independent directors are held in connection with each
regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting and at other times as necessary, and are chaired by the Chairman of the Board of
Directors. The Board of Directors&rsquo; policy is to hold executive sessions without the presence of management, including the
Chief Executive Officer and other non-independent directors. The committees of the Board of Directors also generally meet in executive
session at the end of each committee meeting, except for meetings of the Executive Committee as this committee has no independent
directors. Outside Advisors Our Board of Directors and each of its committees may retain outside advisors, legal counsel, and consultants
of their choosing at our expense. The Board of Directors and its committees need not obtain management&rsquo;s consent to retain
such outside advisors, legal counsel, and consultants.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Board Effectiveness, Board Annual Self-Assessment, Board Education
Our Board of Directors and each of its committees perform an annual self-assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the Board
and its committees in fulfilling their respective obligations. As part of this annual self-assessment, directors are able to provide
feedback on the performance of other directors. The Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee leads the Board
of Directors in its review of the results of the annual self-assessment and takes further action as needed. In addition, all Board
members have the opportunity to attend director education programs to assist them in remaining current with best practices and
developments in corporate governance. Annual RESULTS ANALYZEDResults of the self- assessment analyzed by the Chair of the Nominating

The following table sets forth information, as of April 7, 2020, concerning, except as indicated by the footnotes below: Each person
whom we know beneficially owns more than five percent of our Class A common stock or Class B common stock. &bull;Each of our directors
and nominees for the Board of Directors. &bull;Each of our named executive officers (see the section titled &ldquo;Executive Compensation&rdquo;
beginning on page 39 of this proxy statement). &bull;All of our directors and executive officers as a group. Unless otherwise noted
below, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table is c/o Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View,
California 94043. We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as indicated by the footnotes
below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting
and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property
laws. Applicable percentage ownership is based on 300,047,170 shares of Class A common stock and 46,407,491 shares of Class B common
stock outstanding at April 7, 2020. In computing the number of shares of Class A and Class B common stock beneficially owned by
a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares of Class A common stock subject to options held
by that person that are currently exercisable within sixty days of April 7, 2020, to be outstanding ignoring the withholding of
shares of common stock to cover applicable taxes. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing
the percentage ownership of any other person. Beneficial ownership representing less than one percent is denoted with an asterisk
(*). The information provided in the table is based on our records, information filed with the SEC, and information provided to
us, except where otherwise noted. Non-voting Class C capital stock is not included in the table. Name of Beneficial Owner Voting

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS &mdash;&mdash;RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS POLICY AND PROCEDURE Our written Related Party Transactions Policy provides that we will only enter into or
ratify a transaction with a related party when our Board of Directors, acting through the Audit Committee, determines that the
transaction is in the best interests of Alphabet and our stockholders. For the purposes of this policy, a related party means:
&bull;a member of the Board of Directors (or a nominee to the Board of Directors); &bull;an executive officer; &bull;any person
who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any class of our voting securities; &bull;any immediate family
member of any of the persons listed above and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of such persons;
or &bull;any firm, corporation, partnership, or other entity in which any of the persons listed above is a general partner or principal
or in a similar position or in which any of the persons listed above has a five percent or greater beneficial ownership interest.
A related party is not deemed to have a direct or indirect material interest in a transaction and such transaction is not a related
party transaction under our policy if such related party&rsquo;s interest in such transaction arises only from an ownership interest
of less than five percent in, or as a director of, such entity that is a party to the transaction. We review all known relationships
and transactions in which Alphabet and our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders or their immediate family
members are participants to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect interest. Our legal staff, in consultation
with our finance team, is primarily responsible for developing and implementing processes and controls to obtain information regarding
our directors, executive officers, and significant stockholders with respect to related party transactions and then determining,
based on the facts and circumstances, whether Alphabet or a related party has a direct or indirect interest in these transactions.
On a periodic basis, our legal and finance teams review all transactions involving payments between Alphabet and any company that
has our executive officer or director as an officer or director. In addition, our directors and executive officers are required
to notify us of any potential related party transactions and provide us with the information regarding such transactions. If our
legal department determines that a transaction is a related party transaction, the Audit Committee must review the transaction
and either approve or disapprove it. If advance approval of a transaction is not feasible, the chair of the Audit Committee may
approve the transaction, and the Audit Committee may ratify the transaction in accordance with the Related Party Transactions Policy.
In determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction with a related party, the Audit Committee will take into account all
of the relevant facts and circumstances available to it, including, among any other factors it deems appropriate: &bull;the benefits
to us of the transaction; &bull;the nature of the related party&rsquo;s interest in the transaction; &bull;whether the transaction
would impair the judgment of a director or executive officer to act in the best interests of Alphabet and our stockholders; &bull;the
potential impact of the transaction on a director&rsquo;s independence; and &bull;whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable
than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances. Any member of the Audit
Committee who is a related party with respect to a transaction under review may not participate in the deliberations or vote on
the approval of the transaction. If a related party transaction will be ongoing, the Audit Committee may establish guidelines for
us to follow in our ongoing dealings with the related party. Thereafter, the Audit Committee, on at least an annual basis, will
review and assess ongoing relationships with the related party to monitor compliance with the Audit Committee&rsquo;s guidelines
and that the related party transaction remains appropriate. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, the Audit Committee
will determine if it is in the best interests of Alphabet and its stockholders to continue, modify, or terminate the related party
transaction.</P>

We have entered into an indemnification agreement with each of our directors and executive officers. The indemnification agreements,
our certificate of incorporation, and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and executive officers to the fullest extent
permitted by Delaware law. Use of Moffett Airfield Pursuant to a 60-year lease agreement with NASA in early 2015, we became the
operator of Moffett Airfield (the Airfield). Larry, Sergey, Eric, and Ram, through their affiliated entities (the Founder Entities),
have historically used and paid to NASA applicable fees for the use of the Airfield for their personal aircraft. As the operator
of the Airfield, we charge the Founder Entities fees for the use of the Airfield that are (i) non-preferential when compared to
the fees charged to other private customers landing aircraft at the Airfield, and (ii) derived from rate schedules that are consistent
with what an independent airfield services company believes, based on its industry experience, to be arm&rsquo;s-length terms
that are fair and reasonable to us as the operator. In 2019, we charged the Founder Entities approximately $1,397,089. These flights
have not interfered with our business plans for use of the Airfield. These fees are regularly reviewed by our Audit Committee.
Larry, Sergey, Eric, and Ram do not have a material interest in any of the transactions described above. License of Hangar Space
at Moffett Airfield In December 2015, we entered into an agreement to license a portion of our hangar space at the Airfield to
LTA Research &amp; Exploration LLC (LTA), which is owned by an entity affiliated with Sergey. From the beginning of 2019 through
March 31, 2020, we charged LTA approximately $2,881,462. The Audit Committee believes that this transaction has been conducted
on arm&rsquo;s-length terms that are fair and reasonable to us as the operator of the Airfield based on its review of market comparables
that were further reviewed and validated by an independent real estate services firm. This license has not interfered with our
business plans for the use of the Airfield. Sergey does not have a material interest in the transaction described above. License
of Hangar Space at the San Jose International Airport In November 2015, we entered into an agreement with BCH San Jose LLC (BCH)
to license the use of a portion of BCH&rsquo;s hangar space at the Mineta San Jose International Airport to hold Google&rsquo;s
corporate aircraft. In 2019, we paid approximately $559,562 to BCH. Larry, Sergey, and Eric each own one-third interests in BCH,
through their respective affiliated entities. The Audit Committee reviewed market comparables and has deemed this transaction
to be on terms, taken as a whole, no less favorable to us than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under
the same or similar circumstances. Larry, Sergey, and Eric do not have a material interest in the transaction described above.
Investments in Certain Private Companies Google, GV, and Gradient Ventures directly invested, or committed to invest, an aggregate
of approximately $81.0 million in certain private companies from the beginning of 2019 through March 31, 2020, in which Kleiner

transaction described above. Diane B. Greene In connection with Google&rsquo;s acquisition of bebop Technologies, Inc. (bebop)
in December 2015, Diane, who was the then CEO, director, and stockholder of bebop, became Google Senior Vice President, Chief Executive
Officer, Google Cloud. As part of the bebop transaction, Diane received 200,729 shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock (Merger
Shares) in exchange for her shares in bebop, with the vesting of a portion of such shares subject to continued employment. On January
28, 2019, Diane stepped down from her position as Google Senior Vice President, Chief Executive Officer, Google Cloud, but remained
a member of the Board of Directors until June 19, 2019 (the date of our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders). As of her transition
date, she had 16,572 unvested Merger Shares. On March 15, 2019, the Board of Directors (other than Diane, who recused herself)
unanimously approved a waiver of the employment condition of the vesting of the remaining unvested Merger Shares in light of her
leadership and contribution on the Google Cloud team. At the time of the acquisition, Diane pledged to donate all of the Merger
Shares to a donor advised fund. Office Building Lease In July 2017, we purchased three office buildings in Mountain View, California,
from an unaffiliated third-party seller. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the seller&rsquo;s existing leases were transferred
to us, including a lease with Zee.Aero, Inc. (d/b/a Kitty Hawk Corporation), an entity affiliated with Larry. Kitty Hawk Corporation
currently leases two out of three buildings. From the beginning of 2019 through March 31, 2020, we charged Kitty Hawk Corporation
a total of approximately $2,026,275, in accordance with the rates set forth in the underlying lease agreement that was previously
negotiated between Kitty Hawk Corporation and the third-party seller, and in June 2019 subsequently divided into three separate
lease agreements. Larry does not have a material interest in the transaction described above. Employment Matters The spouse of
David has been employed by Google in a non-executive capacity since April 2018. The total compensation of David&rsquo;s spouse,
which consists of a base salary, bonus, and equity grant, for services provided to Google in fiscal 2019 was approximately $197,000,
and was in line with similar roles at Google. A son of Ruth has been employed by Google in a non-executive capacity since October
2017. The total compensation of Ruth&rsquo;s son, which consists of a base salary, bonus, and equity grant, for services provided
to Google in fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, was below $120,000 each year, and was in line with similar roles at Google. Certain Relationships
From time to time, we engage in certain transactions with other companies affiliated with our directors, executive officers, and
significant stockholders or their immediate family members. We believe that all such arrangements have been entered into in the
ordinary course of business and have been conducted on an arm&rsquo;s-length basis and do not represent a material interest to
such directors, executive officers, or significant stockholders.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">DIRECTOR COMPENSATION &mdash;&mdash;BOARD COMPENSATION
ARRANGEMENTS FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS Alphabet&rsquo;s director compensation program is designed to attract and retain highly
qualified non-employee directors. Our program aligns director compensation with compensation offered by peer companies (identified
in Section 2 of the &ldquo;Compensation Discussion and Analysis&rdquo;) that compete with us for talent. We designed the program
to address the time, effort, expertise, and accountability required of active board membership. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee and Leadership Development and Compensation Committee believe that annual compensation for non-employee directors should
consist of both cash to compensate members for their service on the Board of Directors and its committees, and equity to align
the interests of directors and stockholders. By vesting over time, equity also creates an incentive for continued service on our
Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee
jointly review the compensation programs for non-employee directors on an annual basis. In 2019, we awarded our standard ongoing
compensation to each of our non-employee directors, including an annual $75,000 cash retainer payable in arrears and an annual
$350,000 GSU grant. We paid an additional $25,000 annual cash retainer and an additional $150,000 annual GSU grant to John L. Hennessy,
our non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, given his additional duties in the role. We also paid an additional $25,000
annual cash retainer to Ann for her role as the Audit Committee chairperson. We awarded the above-mentioned cash retainers and
GSU grants to our non-employee directors on July 3, 2019, the first Wednesday of the month following our 2019 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. The exact number of GSUs comprising the equity awards was calculated by dividing the target dollar value of the award
by the closing price of Alphabet&rsquo;s Class C capital stock on the day prior to grant and rounding up to the nearest whole share.
All annual GSU grants made to our non-employee directors vest at the rate of 1/48th monthly, beginning on the 25th day of the month
following the grant date until fully vested, subject to continued service on our Board of Directors through the applicable vesting
dates. Frances was appointed to serve as a member of our Board of Directors and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
effective December 7, 2019. In connection with her appointment, she received our standard initial compensation for new non-employee
directors consisting of a $1.0 million GSU grant made on January 8, 2020 (the first non-holiday Wednesday of the month following
the month of her appointment). These GSUs vest at the rate of 1/4th on the 25th day of the month in which the grant&rsquo;s first
anniversary occurs, and an additional 1/48th vests on the 25th day of each month thereafter, subject to continued service on our
Board of Directors through the applicable vesting dates. Frances did not receive any non-employee director compensation in 2019.
We reimburse our non-employee directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with attendance at Board of Directors
and committee meetings. Under Alphabet&rsquo;s Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Plan, the aggregate amount of stock-based and cash-based
awards that may be granted to any non-employee director in respect of any calendar year, solely with respect to his or her service
as a member of the Board of Directors, is limited to $1.5 million. To align directors&rsquo; interests with those of our stockholders,
each director is required to own shares of Alphabet stock equal in value to at least $1.0 million. Each director has until the
later of (i) April 18, 2020; or (ii) five years from the date he or she became a director to comply with these ownership requirements.
All of our directors either met the applicable minimum stock ownership guideline as of December 31, 2019 or were within the grace
period noted above to come into compliance with these requirements. During 2019, Larry, Sergey, Sundar, and Eric served as our
employee directors and did not receive any compensation for their services as members of our Board of Directors. Diane served as
an employee director until her resignation as Chief Executive Officer of Google Cloud, effective January 29, 2019. Following Diane&rsquo;s
transition to non-employee director status, she received our standard non-employee director cash compensation, prorated for her
period of service as a non-employee director from January 29, 2019 through the expiration of her term. Eric and Diane did not seek
re-election to our Board of Directors at the expiration of their terms on June 19, 2019. Please see the section titled &ldquo;Executive
Compensation&rdquo; for more information about compensation paid to Larry, Sergey, and Sundar who were named executive officers
during 2019.</P>

OF PAY AND FISCAL YEAR 2019 PAY DECISIONS 41 SECTION 4&mdash;OTHER COMPENSATION INFORMATION 42 &mdash;COMPENSATION DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS Overview Our Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&amp;A) includes a detailed discussion of compensation for five
named executive officers during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019: LARRY PAGE Co-Founder and Director SERGEY BRIN Co-Founder
and Director SUNDAR PICHAI Chief Executive Officer, Alphabet and Google, and Director RUTH M. PORAT Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer, Alphabet and Google DAVID C. DRUMMOND Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, and Chief Legal Officer,
Alphabet (retired January 2020) Section 1&mdash;Executive Summary Compensation Philosophy We designed our employee and executive
compensation programs to support three goals: &bull;Attract and retain the world&rsquo;s best talent &bull;Support our culture
of innovation and performance &bull;Align employee and stockholder interests We pay employees competitively compared to other
opportunities they might have in the market. Additionally, we offer competitive benefits to promote the health and happiness of
our employees, provide unique perks that make life and work more convenient, design compelling job opportunities aligned with
our mission, and create a fun and energizing work environment. We believe in pay for performance. Compensation is tied to performance
for all employees who receive more than nominal compensation. The proportion of overall pay tied to performance is higher for
employees at more senior levels in the organization, reflecting their opportunity to have more impact on company performance.
We use equity awards to align employee and stockholder interests. We require our named executive officers and other senior executives
to maintain significant holdings of Alphabet stock. See Section 4 of this CD&amp;A for a description of our minimum stock ownership
requirements.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Transitions and Compensation Highlights In December 2019, Sundar,
previously Chief Executive Officer of Google, became the Chief Executive Officer of both Alphabet and Google. In recognition of
his expanded role, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee approved a new individual compensation arrangement that
increased Sundar&rsquo;s salary to $2.0 million effective January 1, 2020 and granted equity awards in the form of performance
stock units (PSUs) and GSUs. See &ldquo;Equity Awards&rdquo; under Section 3 of this CD&amp;A for additional details. In conjunction
with Sundar&rsquo;s expanded role, Larry and Sergey transitioned from their roles as Chief Executive Officer, Alphabet, and President,
Alphabet, respectively, and will remain active as Co-Founders and members of our Board of Directors. Larry and Sergey will continue
to receive salaries of $1 each per year. On January 31, 2020, David, former Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, and Chief
Legal Officer, Alphabet, retired and exited Alphabet. Section 2&mdash;Determining Competitive Levels of Pay Our executive compensation
decisions are informed by market data in addition to the reviews of individual roles and performance. We use peer group data to
obtain compensation benchmarks for our named executive officers. For 2019, we determined our peer group by evaluating potential
companies against the following criteria: &bull;High-technology or media company &bull;Key talent competitor &bull;High-growth,
with a minimum of 50% of Alphabet&rsquo;s revenue and/or headcount growth over the previous two-year period &bull;$25 billion or
more in annual revenue &bull;$100 billion or more in market capitalization Considering these criteria, in October 2018, the Leadership
Development and Compensation Committee selected the following peer companies for 2019: Amazon.com, Inc. Facebook, Inc. Netflix,
Inc. Apple Inc. Intel Corporation Oracle Corporation Cisco Systems, Inc. International Business Machines Corporation Salesforce.com,
Inc. Comcast Corporation Microsoft Corporation The Walt Disney Company When appropriate, we supplement publicly available peer
group data with comparable opportunities at other S&amp;P 500 companies and startup organizations. Process for Determining Compensation
We regularly review our compensation levels against our peer group. We also assess executives based on their individual performance
and overall company performance. Management uses this information to develop compensation recommendations for our named executive
officers. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee then reviews these recommendations and makes the final decision
on compensation for named executive officers. Say-on-Pay We hold our advisory vote on executive compensation (commonly known as
a &ldquo;say-on-pay&rdquo; vote) every three years, and hold our advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes (commonly known
as &ldquo;say-when-on-pay&rdquo; vote) every six years. We are holding our advisory say-on-pay vote at the Annual Meeting (See
Proposal Number 4 in this proxy statement), and will hold our advisory say-when-on-pay vote at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders.
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee annually reevaluates our compensation practices to determine how they might
be improved.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Section 3&mdash;Elements of Pay and Fiscal Year 2019 Pay Decisions
Base Salary We use salaries to provide employees, including our named executive officers, a steady income in line with their skills,
experiences, and the job opportunities available to them outside of Alphabet, as appropriate. In 2019, the Leadership Development
and Compensation Committee maintained annual salaries for Sundar, Ruth, and David at $650,000. Larry and Sergey continued to receive
salaries of $1 each per year. Effective January 1, 2020, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee increased Sundar&rsquo;s
annual salary to $2.0 million in recognition of his expanded role as Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google. Equity Awards
Our named executive officers do not receive cash bonuses and receive all variable pay through equity awards. We grant equity awards
to our named executive officers (other than Larry and Sergey) to reinforce management&rsquo;s focus on long-term stockholder value
and commitment to the company. We typically design these awards to cover a multi-year period in order to reward long-term performance.
As a result, a named executive officer may not receive an equity award every year, and the corresponding Summary Compensation Table
values will be higher in years that he or she receives an equity award compared to years when he or she does not receive an equity
award. In December 2019, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee granted Sundar PSUs and GSUs under a new award structure
vesting over the period from January 2020 through December 2022 as detailed below. Our other named executive officers did not receive
equity awards during 2019. 2019 PSUs Sundar received a $90.0 million PSU award structured as follows: &bull;Two tranches with a
target value of $45.0 million each &mdash;&mdash;The target number of PSUs for each tranche (34,502) was determined at grant by
dividing the target value of each tranche by $1,304.28, the average closing price of Alphabet&rsquo;s Class C capital stock during
the month of November 2019 &bull;The PSUs vest based on Alphabet&rsquo;s total shareholder return (TSR) performance relative to
the S&amp;P 100 during the performance period as follows: &mdash;&mdash;The first tranche will vest, or not, based on Alphabet&rsquo;s
relative TSR over the two-year performance period from January 2020 to December 2021 &mdash;&mdash;The second tranche will vest,
or not, based on Alphabet&rsquo;s relative TSR over the three-year performance period from January 2020 to December 2022 &bull;The
number of PSUs vesting for each tranche will be determined after the end of each performance period based on the payout curve illustrated
below. Depending upon performance, the number of PSUs that vest will range from 0%-200% of target 0% 50% 100% 150% 200% 25th050th75th100thPercentage
of Target PSUsVesting(1) TSR Percentile Rank vs. S&amp;P 100TARGETMAXIMUMPSU Payout CurveTHRESHOLD (1) The number of PSUs vesting
will be determined by linear interpolation for relative TSR ranks between the 25th and 50th percentile and between the 50th and
75th percentile &bull;Upon vesting, each PSU will entitle Sundar to receive one share of Alphabet&rsquo;s Class C capital stock</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">2019 GSUs Sundar received the following GSU awards: &bull;$120.0
million award, vesting quarterly in twelve equal installments beginning on March 25, 2020 &bull;$30.0 million award, vesting quarterly
in four equal installments beginning on March 25, 2020. This GSU award is a one-time transitional award given Sundar&rsquo;s last
equity award was granted in 2016 Section 4&mdash;Other Compensation Information The first three sections of this CD&amp;A describe
how we think about compensation and how that affects our pay practices. Other compensation-related details that may be important
considerations for our investors are discussed below. Risk Considerations The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee
reviewed our compensation programs for employees and concluded that these programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely
to have a material adverse effect on the company. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee believes that the design
of our annual and long-term incentives focuses performance on long-term value creation and discourages short-term risk taking at
the expense of long-term results. A substantial portion of employees&rsquo; compensation is delivered in the form of equity awards,
further aligning their interests with those of stockholders. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee believes that
the following risk oversight and compensation design features safeguard against excessive risk-taking: &bull;The Board of Directors
as a whole has responsibility for risk oversight and regularly reviews reports on the deliberations of Board committees. In addition,
the Board of Directors reviews the strategic, financial, and execution risks and exposures associated with the financial, operational,
and capital decisions that serve as inputs to our compensation programs. &bull;Through discussions with management, the Leadership
Development and Compensation Committee gains insight into a reasonable range of future company performance expectations. This information
is incorporated into decisions regarding compensation of our named executive officers. &bull;The majority of compensation provided
to our named executive officers is delivered in GSUs and/or PSUs, with payout based on long-term company performance. As compensation
of our named executive officers is tied to long-term performance, their interests are closely aligned with stockholders and they
are motivated to carefully assess risks to the company to protect their compensation. &bull;Given that equity compensation comprises
a high percentage of our named executive officers&rsquo; overall pay: &mdash;&mdash;Our equity awards are subject to vesting conditions
that encourage focus on long-term interests rather than only short-term results, and create meaningful incentives for executive
retention. &mdash;&mdash;Our named executive officers are subject to, and are in compliance with, Alphabet&rsquo;s minimum stock
ownership requirements (detailed in the Minimum Stock Ownership Requirements section below). This ensures that each named executive
officer will hold a significant amount of our equity to further align his or her interests with those of our stockholders over
the long term. &mdash;&mdash;We prohibit all speculative, short-sale, short-term and hedging transactions involving our securities.
As a result, our named executive officers cannot insulate themselves from the effects of poor stock price performance. &mdash;&mdash;We
have internal controls over financial reporting, the measurement and calculation of performance relative to goals, and other financial,
operational, and compliance policies and practices designed to protect our compensation programs from manipulation by any employee.
Timing of Equity Award Grants The effective grant date for equity awards to employees, members of our Board of Directors, and non-employee
advisors is typically the first non-holiday Wednesday of the month following the date on which the equity award is approved by
the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee, unless otherwise specified by our Board of Directors or the Leadership Development
and Compensation Committee. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee does not grant equity awards in anticipation
of the release of material nonpublic information. Similarly, we do not time the release of material nonpublic information based
on equity award grant dates.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Minimum Stock Ownership Requirements To align our named executive
officers&rsquo; interests with those of our stockholders, the Board of Directors has instituted minimum stock ownership requirements
under our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Our current minimum stock ownership requirements are as follows: (i) the Founders of
Google and the Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google shall each own shares of Alphabet stock equal in value to at least
$30.0 million; and (ii) senior vice presidents of Alphabet or Google shall each own shares of Alphabet stock equal in value to
at least $6.0 million. The Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet and Google, and senior vice presidents of Alphabet or Google shall
have five years from hire or promotion to their respective levels to comply with the minimum stock ownership requirements. Alphabet
advisors who do not receive annual equity awards and the chief executive officers of Alphabet&rsquo;s Other Bets are exempt from
the minimum stock ownership requirements. All of our named executive officers have met the applicable minimum stock ownership requirements
as of December 31, 2019. Insider Trading, Hedging, and Pledging Policies Our policy against insider trading prohibits all employees
and directors from engaging in any speculative or hedging transactions in our securities. We prohibit hedging transactions such
as puts, calls, collars, swaps, forward sale contracts, exchange funds, and similar arrangements or instruments designed to hedge
or offset decreases in the market value of Alphabet&rsquo;s securities. No employee or director may engage in short sales of Alphabet
securities, hold Alphabet securities in a margin account, or pledge Alphabet securities as collateral for a loan. Perquisites and
Other Benefits Like all employees, our named executive officers are eligible to participate in various employee benefit plans,
including medical, dental, and vision care plans, flexible spending accounts for health and dependent care, life, accidental death
and dismemberment, disability, and travel insurance, survivor income benefit, employee assistance programs (e.g., confidential
counseling), and paid time off. We also pay life insurance premiums for all employees (other than Larry and Sergey). In addition,
we maintain a tax qualified 401(k) retirement savings plan with both pre-tax and after-tax Roth savings features for eligible employees,
including our named executive officers. In 2019, we provided a company match equal to the greater of 100% of contributions up to
$3,000, or 50% of the maximum contribution under the Internal Revenue Code ($19,000) for a maximum match of $9,500, per employee
(other than Larry and Sergey). Our company match is fully vested at the time of contribution. Participants are not taxed on their
pre-tax contributions or earnings on those contributions until distribution, but pre-tax contributions and all company matching
contributions are deductible by us when made. Participants are taxed on their after-tax Roth contributions, and all company matching
contributions and after-tax Roth contributions are deductible by us when made. In 2019, we paid for personal security for Sundar,
and incremental costs related to the personal use of non-commercial aircraft for Sundar, Ruth, and David. Pursuant to our Non-Commercial
Aircraft Policy, which sets forth the guidelines and procedures for the personal use of non-commercial aircraft, named executive
officers and their guests may use company aircraft with appropriate approvals and pay tax on any associated imputed income. No
Additional Executive Benefit Plans Since we do not generally differentiate the benefits we offer our named executive officers from
the benefits we offer other employees, we do not maintain any benefit plans that cover only select named executive officers. We
also do not maintain any executive retirement programs such as executive pension plans or supplemental executive retirement plans.</P>

by the named executive officers in the relevant fiscal year. Includes amounts deferred pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. (2) Amounts reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of GSUs and PSUs computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic
718 and are not necessarily an indication of the value that will be realized if and when vesting occurs. The grant date fair value
of each GSU award is measured based on the closing price of our Class C capital stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair
value of each PSU award is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model as PSUs contain a market condition at the time of grant
(as calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 and SAB Topic 14). (3) Generally consists of our 401(k) plan company match
of up to $9,500 and personal use of company aircraft, unless otherwise noted. The aggregate incremental cost of personal use of
the company aircraft is calculated based on a cost-per-flight-hour charge developed by a nationally recognized and independent
service. The charge reflects the direct operating cost of the aircraft, including fuel, additives and lubricants, an allocable
allowance for airframe, engine and APU maintenance and restoration, crew travel expenses, on-board catering, and trip-related landing/hangar/ramp
fees and parking costs. This charge does not include any fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as pilots&rsquo; and
other employees&rsquo; salaries, home hangar expenses, and general taxes and insurance. (4) In conjunction with Sundar&rsquo;s
expanded role, Larry and Sergey transitioned to advisors from their roles as Chief Executive Officer, Alphabet and President, Alphabet,
respectively. Larry and Sergey will continue to receive salaries of $1 each per year. (5) The aggregate grant date fair value of
the GSUs granted ($155,954,092) was measured based on the closing price of our Class C capital stock on the date of grant. The
aggregate grant date fair value of the PSUs granted ($120,657,979) was measured using a Monte Carlo simulation model as PSUs contain
a market condition at the time of grant. Assuming the maximum achievement of the TSR performance goals, the aggregate market value
of the PSUs on the date of grant would be $187,144,368. See &ldquo;Equity Awards&rdquo; under Section 3 of the CD&amp;A and the
&ldquo;Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2019&rdquo; table for details on the GSUs and PSUs awarded. (6) Includes $3,339,695 for personal
security.</P>

PSUs held by the applicable named executive officer by the closing price of our Class C capital stock on December 31, 2019, which
was $1,337.02 per share. (4) The unvested PSUs were granted on December 19, 2019 and will vest in two tranches based on TSR performance
of Alphabet relative to the companies comprising the S&amp;P 100 over a 2020-2021 performance period for the first tranche and
over a 2020-2022 performance period for the second tranche. The vesting of each tranche will be subject to continued employment
through the date the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee determines achievement of our relative TSR following the
end of each performance period other than in the event of death or termination without cause. See &ldquo;Equity Awards&rdquo; under
Section 3 of the CD&amp;A for further details regarding vesting conditions of the PSUs. The number of PSUs included in the table
reflects achievement of market-based goals at the threshold level for each tranche. (5) This award vests as follows: 1/4th of GSUs
vested on March 25, 2020 and an additional 1/4th will vest quarterly thereafter until the units are fully vested, subject to continued
employment on such vesting dates. (6) This award vests as follows: 1/12th of GSUs vested on March 25, 2020 and an additional 1/12th
will vest quarterly thereafter until the units are fully vested, subject to continued employment on such vesting dates. (7) This
award vests as follows: Any PSUs vesting per the applicable grant agreement with respect to the January 1, 2020 to December 31,
2021 performance period (Target = 34,502, but between 0 and 69,004 may vest in accordance with the market-based requirements in
the applicable grant agreement) will vest within 45 days after December 31, 2021; and any PSUs vesting per the applicable grant
agreement with respect to the January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022 performance period (Target = 34,502, but between 0 and 69,004
may vest in accordance with the market-based requirements in the applicable grant agreement) will vest within 45 days after December
31, 2022. (8) This award vests as follows: 1/16th of GSUs vested on March 25, 2018 with an additional 1/16th vesting quarterly
thereafter until the units are fully vested, subject to continued employment on such vesting dates.

realized on exercise is calculated as the product of (a) the number of shares of our Class A common stock or Class C capital stock,
as applicable, for which the stock options were exercised and (b) the excess of the closing price of our Class A common stock or
Class C capital stock, as applicable, on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of the exercise over the applicable exercise
price per share of the stock options. (2) The value realized on vesting is calculated as the product of (a) the number of shares

of our Class A common stock or Class C capital stock, as applicable, on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the day before vesting.
&mdash;&mdash;POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL We have no agreements with our named executive officers
that provide for additional or accelerated compensation upon termination of the executive&rsquo;s employment or a change in control
of Alphabet, except as set forth below. In the event of a change in control of Alphabet and, unless our Board of Directors or Leadership
Development and Compensation Committee determines otherwise, if the successor corporation does not assume or substitute the equity
awards held by our employees, including our named executive officers, all unvested stock options and unvested GSUs will fully vest
and the target award for each tranche of Sundar&rsquo;s PSUs will fully vest. Effective December 17, 2019, the Leadership Development
and Compensation Committee approved an amendment to Alphabet&rsquo;s form of restricted stock unit agreement under the Amended
and Restated 2012 Stock Plan for future grants, such that, similar to GSUs granted to all other Alphabet employees, GSUs granted
to directors and named executive officers of Alphabet will immediately vest in full upon termination of service on the Board, or
of employment, by reason of death. In respect to Sundar&rsquo;s PSUs: &bull;Upon a termination of employment by reason of death
(i) prior to the start of the performance period of a tranche or during the performance period of a tranche, the target number
of PSUs for such tranche will immediately vest in full as of the date of such termination of employment and (ii) following the
end of the performance period of a tranche but prior to the determination date with respect to such tranche, the number of PSUs
earned based on actual performance will immediately vest as of the determination date &bull;Upon a termination of employment by
Alphabet without cause (as defined in the PSU agreement) prior to the determination date for a tranche but after the start of the
performance period with respect to such tranche, the number of PSUs earned based on actual performance will be prorated based on
the number of calendar days in the performance period Sundar was performing services and the pro rata portion will vest as of the
determination date The table on page 49 of this proxy statement shows our estimates of the value each of our named executive officers
would have received if their unvested GSUs (and in Sundar&rsquo;s case, PSUs) had become fully vested as a result of termination
of employment by reason of a change in control or death occurring on December 31, 2019. All stock options held by our named executive
officers as of December 31, 2019 are fully vested.</P>

Chief Executive Officer Sundar&rsquo;s total compensation to that of Alphabet&rsquo;s median employee for the year ended December
31, 2019. Chief Executive Officer total annual compensation $280,621,552 Median Employee total annual compensation $258,708 Ratio
of Chief Executive Officer to Median Employee total annual compensation 1,085 : 1 To determine the median employee compensation,
we analyzed all of Alphabet&rsquo;s employees, excluding Alphabet&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, as of December 31, 2019. We
annualized wages and salaries for employees that were not employed for the full year. We used base salary and actual bonus as the
consistently applied compensation metric to determine the median employee. If this resulted in more than one individual at the
median level, we assessed the grant date fair value of standard equity awards for these individuals and selected the employee with
the median award value. After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for the median employee
according to the methodology used to report the annual compensation of our named executive officers in the Summary Compensation
Table on page 45.</P>

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Alphabet is comprised entirely of independent directors who meet the independence
requirements of the Listing Rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market and the SEC. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a charter that
is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at https://abc.xyz/investor/other/board/#audit-committee. The Audit
Committee oversees Alphabet&rsquo;s financial reporting process and internal control structure on behalf of the Board of Directors.
Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of the financial statements and the effectiveness of
Alphabet&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Alphabet&rsquo;s independent auditors are responsible for expressing
an opinion as to the conformity of Alphabet&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles
and as to the effectiveness of Alphabet&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. In performing its responsibilities,
the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the independent auditors the audited consolidated financial
statements in Alphabet&rsquo;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Audit Committee has also discussed
with Ernst &amp; Young LLP, Alphabet&rsquo;s independent auditors, the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No.
1301, &ldquo;Communications with Audit Committees&rdquo; issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The Audit
Committee received written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors pursuant to the applicable requirements of
the PCAOB regarding the independent auditors&rsquo; communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit
Committee discussed with the auditors their independence. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee
unanimously recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Alphabet&rsquo;s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. AUDIT COMMITTEE Ann Mather, Chair Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. Alan

Registered Public Accounting Firm The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed Ernst &amp; Young LLP as the independent
registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, Ernst &amp; Young LLP served as our independent registered public accounting firm
and also provided certain audit- related, tax, and other services. See &ldquo;Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm&rdquo;
on page 51 of this proxy statement. The Audit Committee believes that the continued retention of Ernst &amp; Young LLP as our independent
registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of Alphabet and our stockholders. Notwithstanding its selection, the
Audit Committee, in its discretion, may appoint another independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year
if the Audit Committee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of Alphabet and our stockholders. If our stockholders
do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee may reconsider whether it should appoint another independent registered public
accounting firm. Representatives of Ernst &amp; Young LLP are expected to participate in the Annual Meeting, where they will be
available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, to make a statement. Required Vote Ratification of the appointment

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Proposal Number 3 Approval of an Amendment to Alphabet&rsquo;s
Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Plan At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will be asked to approve an amendment to the Alphabet
Inc. Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Plan (the Plan), in order to increase the maximum number of shares of our Class C capital
stock that may be issued under the Plan by 8,500,000 shares. In April 2020, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee
recommended and the full Board of Directors adopted, subject to stockholder approval, an amendment to the Plan to increase the
share reserve by 8,500,000 shares of Class C capital stock. Our stockholders have previously authorized us to issue under the Plan
up to a total of 88,000,000 shares of Class C capital stock, subject to adjustment upon certain changes in our capital structure.
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee and the full Board of Directors believe that in order to successfully attract
and retain the best possible candidates, we must continue to offer a competitive equity incentive program. The proposed share reserve
increase would allow Alphabet to continue its current granting practices. As of December 31, 2019, of the 88,000,000 shares of
Class C capital stock authorized for issuance under the Plan, 37,982,435 shares remained available for future grants of stock awards,
a number that the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee and the full Board of Directors believes to be insufficient
to meet our anticipated needs. Therefore, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee recommended, and the full Board
of Directors approved, subject to stockholder approval, an increase in the maximum number of shares of Class C capital stock issuable
under the Plan by 8,500,000 shares to a total of 96,500,00 shares of Class C capital stock, subject to adjustment upon certain
changes in our capital structure. Summary of the Plan The material features of the Plan are summarized below. This summary is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Plan, which is set forth in Appendix A to this proxy statement. Purpose The
Board of Directors of Google originally adopted the Plan in April 2012, and it was approved by the stockholders of Google in June
2012. The Plan was subsequently assumed by Alphabet in October 2015 and amended by the Board of Directors, the Leadership Development
and Compensation Committee and stockholders in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, and amended and restated in its entirety by the Board
of Directors, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee, and stockholders in 2019. The Plan is intended to promote
the interests of Alphabet and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) and its stockholders by providing the employees and
consultants of the Company and members of the Board of Directors with incentives and rewards to encourage them to continue in the
service of the Company and with a proprietary interest in pursuing the long-term growth, profitability, and financial success of
the Company. Administration The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee administers the Plan in accordance with its terms.
The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee has full discretionary authority to administer the Plan, including without
limitation, the authority to: (1) designate the employees and consultants of the Company and members of the Board of Directors
who shall be granted incentive awards under the Plan and the amount, type and other terms and conditions of such incentive awards
and (2) interpret and construe any and all provisions of the Plan and the terms of any incentive award (and any agreement evidencing
the grant of an incentive award). The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee may exercise all discretion granted to
it under the Plan in a non- uniform manner among participants. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee may delegate
to a subcommittee of one or more members of the Board of Directors or employees of the Company the authority to grant incentive
awards, subject to such limitations as the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee shall specify and to the requirements
of applicable law. Eligibility Any employee or consultant of, or person who renders services directly or indirectly to, the Company
and any member of the Board of Directors is eligible for selection by the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee to
receive an incentive award under the Plan (such a person who is selected to receive an incentive award is referred to herein as
a participant). As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 118,899 full-time employees and eleven members of the Board of Directors
(including three employee directors).</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Shares Subject to the Plan Currently, the maximum number of
shares of Class C capital stock that may be covered by incentive awards granted under the Plan shall not exceed 88,000,000 shares
in the aggregate. Currently, the maximum number of shares of Class C capital stock that may be covered by incentive awards granted
under the Plan that are intended to be incentive stock options (ISOs) shall not exceed 88,000,000 shares in the aggregate. As of
December 31, 2019, of the 88,000,000 shares of Class C capital stock authorized for issuance under the Plan, 37,982,435 shares
of stock remained available for future grant of stock awards. Assuming stockholders approve this proposal, a total of 96,500,000
shares of Class C capital stock will have been reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan. Assuming stockholders approve this proposal,
the maximum number of shares of Class C capital stock that may be covered by incentive awards granted under the Plan that are intended
to be ISOs shall not exceed 96,500,000. For purposes of these maximum share limitations, shares of Class C capital stock shall
only be counted as used to the extent that they are actually issued and delivered to a participant (or such participant&rsquo;s
permitted transferees as described in the Plan) pursuant to the Plan. Accordingly, if an incentive award is settled for cash or
if shares of Class C capital stock are withheld to pay the exercise price of a stock option or to satisfy any tax withholding requirements
in connection with an incentive award, only the shares issued (if any), net of the shares withheld, will be deemed delivered for
purposes of determining the number of shares of Class C capital stock that are available for delivery under the Plan. In addition,
shares of Class C capital stock related to incentive awards that expire, are forfeited or cancelled, or terminate for any reason
without the issuance of shares shall not be treated as issued pursuant to the Plan. In addition, if shares of Class C capital stock
owned by a participant (or such participant&rsquo;s permitted transferees as described in the Plan) are tendered (either actually
or through attestation) to the Company in payment of any obligation in connection with an incentive award, the number of shares
tendered shall be added to the number of shares of Class C capital stock that are available for delivery under the Plan. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, shares of Class C capital stock attributable to incentive awards transferred under any incentive
award transfer program (as described below) shall not again be available for delivery under the Plan. As of April 7, 2020, the
market value of a share of Class C capital stock was $1,186.51. Award Types The Plan permits grants of the following types of incentive
awards subject to such terms and conditions as the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee shall determine, consistent
with the terms of the Plan: (1) stock options, including stock options intended to qualify as ISOs, (2) other stock-based awards,
including in the form of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units (including performance-based
restricted stock units), performance shares, deferred share units or share- denominated performance units, and (3) cash awards.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan, incentive awards may be settled in cash or shares of Class C capital
stock and may be subject to performance-based and/or service-based conditions. Stock Options The Plan permits the Leadership Development
and Compensation Committee to grant stock options, including ISOs, which are stock options that are designated by the Leadership
Development and Compensation Committee as incentive stock options and which meet the applicable requirements of incentive stock
options pursuant to Section 422 of the Code, subject to certain terms and conditions. Exercise Price. The exercise price per share
of Class C capital stock covered by a stock option shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of a share of Class C capital
stock on the date on which such stock option is granted. For this purpose, fair market value (Fair Market Value) is determined
as being equal to the closing sales price on the date of grant or, if not so reported for such day, the immediately preceding business
day, of a share of Class C capital stock as reported on the principal securities exchange on which shares of Class C capital stock
are listed and admitted to trading. Terms Applicable to Stock Options. A stock option granted to a participant under the Plan allows
a participant to purchase up to a specified total number of shares of Class C capital stock at a specified exercise price per share
during specified time periods, each as determined by the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee in its discretion, provided
that no stock option may have a term of longer than ten (10) years. Additional Terms for ISOs. Stock options granted under the
Plan that are intended to qualify as ISOs are subject to certain additional terms and conditions as set forth in the Plan, including:
(1) each stock option that is intended to qualify as an ISO must be designated as an ISO in the agreement evidencing its grant,
(2) ISOs may only be granted to individuals who are employees of the Company, (3) the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as
of the date of grant of the ISOs) of the number of shares of Class C capital stock with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for
the first time by any participant during any calendar year under all plans of the Company shall not exceed $100,000, or such other
maximum amount as is then applicable under Section 422 of the Code, and (4) no ISO may be granted to a person who, at the time
of the proposed grant, owns (or is deemed to own under the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined
voting power of all classes of common stock of the Company unless (a) the exercise price of such ISO is at least one hundred ten
percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Class C capital stock at the time such ISO is granted and (b) such ISO is
not exercisable after the expiration of five years from the date it is granted. Any stock option granted under the Plan that is
designated as an ISO but for any reason fails to meet the requirements of an ISO shall be treated under the Plan as a nonstatutory
stock option.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Repricing Prohibited. Alphabet may not reprice any stock option
granted under the Plan without the approval of the stockholders of Alphabet. For this purpose, &ldquo;reprice&rdquo; means (1)
any of the following or any other action that has the same effect: (a) lowering the exercise price of a stock option after it is
granted, (b) any other action that is treated as a repricing under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), or (c)
cancelling a stock option at a time when its exercise price exceeds the fair market value of the underlying Class C capital stock,
in exchange for another stock option, restricted stock, or other equity, unless the cancellation and exchange occurs in connection
with a merger, acquisition, spin-off or other similar corporate transaction; and (2) any other action that is considered to be
a repricing under formal or informal guidance issued by NASDAQ. Non-Employee Director Awards Any awards granted to non-employee
members of the Board of Directors under the Plan in respect of any calendar year, solely with respect to his or her service to
the Board of Directors, may not exceed $1,500,000, based on the aggregate value of cash-based awards and the fair market value
of any stock-based awards granted under the Plan, in each case determined as of the date of grant. The Board of Directors will
reassess this cap at least once every five years. As of December 31, 2019, there were eight non-employee members of the Board of
Directors. Incentive Award Transfer Program Each of the Board of Directors and the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee
has the authority under the Plan to implement a program, which would permit participants the opportunity to transfer any outstanding
incentive awards to a financial institution or other person selected by the Board of Directors or the Leadership Development and
Compensation Committee. Amendment and Termination The Board of Directors may at any time suspend or discontinue the Plan or revise
or amend the Plan in any respect whatsoever, provided that to the extent that any applicable law, tax requirement, or rule of a
stock exchange requires stockholder approval in order for any such revision or amendment to be effective, such revision or amendment
shall not be effective without such approval. Except as expressly provided in the Plan, no action under the Plan may, without the
consent of a participant, reduce the participant&rsquo;s rights under any previously granted and outstanding incentive award. Adjustments
Upon Certain Changes The Plan includes provisions that require or permit the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee
to make certain adjustments upon the occurrence of specified events, including provisions that provide as follows: (1) upon the

Awards ISOs. A participant who is granted an ISO does not recognize taxable income at the time the ISO is granted or upon its exercise,
but the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares acquired on the exercise date (ISO shares) over the aggregate exercise
price paid by the participant is included in the participant&rsquo;s income for alternative minimum tax purposes. Upon a disposition
of the ISO shares more than two years after grant of the ISOs and one year after exercise of the ISOs, any gain or loss is treated
as long- term capital gain or loss. In such case, Alphabet would not be entitled to a deduction. If the participant sells the ISO
shares prior to the expiration of these holding periods, the participant recognizes ordinary income at the time of disposition
equal to the excess if any, of the lesser of (1) the aggregate fair market value of the ISO shares at the date of exercise and
(2) the amount received for the ISO shares, over the aggregate exercise price previously paid by the participant. Any gain or loss

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">disposition of the ISO shares in excess of the amount treated
as ordinary income is treated as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long the shares were held by the
participant prior to the sale. The amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant is subject to payroll taxes. Alphabet
is entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount as the participant recognizes ordinary income. Nonstatutory
Stock Options. A participant who is granted a stock option that is not an ISO (a nonstatutory stock option) does not recognize
any taxable income at the time of grant. Upon exercise, the participant recognizes taxable income equal to the aggregate fair market
value of the shares subject to nonstatutory stock options over the aggregate exercise price of such shares. Any taxable income
recognized in connection with the exercise of nonstatutory stock options by an employee is subject to payroll taxes. Alphabet is
entitled to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount as the participant recognizes ordinary income. The participant&rsquo;s
basis in the option shares will be increased by the amount of ordinary income recognized. Upon the sale of the shares issued upon
exercise of nonstatutory stock options, any further gain or loss recognized will be treated as long-term or short-term capital
gain or loss, depending on how long the shares were held by the participant prior to the sale. Restricted Stock and Restricted
Stock Units. A participant will not recognize income at the time restricted stock is granted. When the restrictions lapse with
regard to any portion of restricted stock, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the
vested shares, unless the participant elected to realize ordinary income in the year of the grant equal to the fair market value
of the restricted stock awarded, determined without regard to the restrictions. A participant will not recognize income at the
time restricted stock units (GSUs) or performance-based restricted stock units (PSUs) are granted. When GSUs or PSUs vest, the
participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the cash paid or to be paid or the fair market value of the shares delivered
or to be delivered. The amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant is subject to payroll taxes. Alphabet is entitled
to a deduction at the same time and in the same amount as the participant recognizes ordinary income. Section 162(m) Compensation
Deduction Limitation. In general, Section 162(m) limits Alphabet&rsquo;s compensation deduction to $1,000,000 paid in any tax year
to any &ldquo;covered employee&rdquo; as defined under Section 162(m), as amended. A &ldquo;covered employee&rdquo; includes each
individual who served as Alphabet&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer at any time during the taxable year,
each of the three other most highly compensated officers of the Company for the taxable year, and any other individual who was
a covered employee of the Company for the preceding tax year beginning after December 31, 2016. THE FOREGOING IS ONLY A SUMMARY

TO BE COMPLETE AND DOES NOT DISCUSS THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INDIVIDUAL&rsquo;S DEATH OR THE PROVISIONS OF THE INCOME TAX LAWS
OF ANY MUNICIPALITY, STATE, OR FOREIGN COUNTRY IN WHICH ANY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL MAY RESIDE. Plan Benefits The amount and timing
of awards granted under the Plan are determined in the sole discretion of the administrator and therefore cannot be determined
in advance. The future awards that would be received under the Plan by executive officers and other employees are discretionary
and are therefore not determinable at this time. Required Vote Approval of the proposed amendment to the Plan to increase the maximum
number of shares of our Class C capital stock that may be issued under the Plan by 8,500,000 shares requires the affirmative &ldquo;FOR&rdquo;
vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of Alphabet&rsquo;s shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock
present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class. Unless marked
to the contrary, proxies received will be voted &ldquo;FOR&rdquo; approval of the amendment to the Plan. Alphabet Recommendation
We believe strongly that the approval of the increase in the number of Class C capital stock issuable under the Plan by 8,500,000
shares is essential to our continued success. Our employees are among our most valuable assets. Equity awards provided under the
Plan are vital to our ability to attract and retain outstanding and highly skilled individuals. Such awards also are crucial to
our ability to motivate employees to achieve our goals. For the reasons stated above the stockholders are being asked to approve
the amendment to the Plan. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CLASS C CAPITAL
STOCK ISSUABLE UNDER THE PLAN BY 8,500,000 SHARES.</P>

Executive Officers As required by the SEC&rsquo;s proxy rules, we are seeking an advisory, non-binding stockholder vote with respect
to compensation awarded to our named executive officers. Our executive compensation program and compensation paid to our named
executive officers are described on pages 39-49 of this proxy statement. Our compensation programs are overseen by the Leadership

in ways that support three primary business objectives: &bull;Attract and retain the world&rsquo;s best talent &bull;Support Alphabet&rsquo;s
culture of innovation and performance &bull;Align employee and stockholder interests To help achieve these objectives, we structure
our named executive officers&rsquo; compensation to reward the achievement of short-term and long-term strategic and operational
goals. You are being asked to approve the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: Resolved, that the stockholders approve,
on an advisory basis, the compensation awarded to Alphabet&rsquo;s named executive officers, as disclosed under SEC rules, including
the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and related narrative disclosures included in this proxy statement.
Required Vote Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative &ldquo;FOR&rdquo; vote of the holders of a majority of the voting
power of Alphabet&rsquo;s shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Proposal Number 5 Stockholder Proposal Regarding Equal Shareholder
Voting Give Each Share an Equal Vote RESOLVED: Shareholders request that our Board take all practicable steps in its control to
initiate and adopt a recapitalization plan for all outstanding stock to have one vote per share. We recommend that this be done
through a phase-out process in which the board would, at the earliest practicable time, establish fair and appropriate mechanisms
through which disproportionate rights of Class B shareholders could be eliminated. This is not intended to unnecessarily limit
our Board&rsquo;s judgment in crafting the requested change in accordance with applicable laws and existing contracts. SUPPORTING
STATEMENT: In our company&rsquo;s multi-class voting structure, Class B stock has 10 times the voting rights of Class A. As a result,
Mr. Page and Mr. Brin currently control over 51% of our company&rsquo;s total voting power, while owning less than 13% of stock
&ndash; and will continue to do so even though they have stepped down from leading our company. This raises concerns that the interests
of public shareholders may be subordinated to those of our co-founders. Due to this voting structure, our company takes public
shareholder money but refuses shareholders an equal voice in our company&rsquo;s management. For example, it was primarily the
weight of the insiders&rsquo; 10 votes per share that permitted the creation of a non-voting class of stock (class C) despite the
fact that the &rdquo;majority of [shareholders] voted to oppose the maneuver.&rdquo; The New York Times reported that &ldquo;only
about 12.7 percent of Google&rsquo;s Class A stockholders &mdash; other than Mr. Brin, Mr. Page and other Google directors and
employees &mdash; voted in support of issuing the Class C stock &hellip; With little regard for the shareholders&rsquo; opinion,
Google continued with the plan.&rdquo; A variety of corporate governance experts illustrate a growing concern about multi-class
share structures: . As of July 2017, the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices announced that certain indices will no longer add companies
with multiple share class structures; . The executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors (CII) has stated that
&ldquo;multi-class structures &hellip; rob shareholders of the power to press for change when something goes wrong&rdquo; and recommends
a seven year phase-out of dual class share offerings; . The International Corporate Governance Network supports CII&rsquo;s recommendation
&ldquo;to require to a time-based sunset clause for dual class shares to revert to a traditional one-share/one-vote structure no
more than seven years after a company&rsquo;s IPO date.&rdquo; . The Investor Stewardship Group recommends that &ldquo;shareholders
should be entitled to voting rights in proportion to their economic interest&rdquo; and &ldquo;boards should have a strong, independent
leadership structure.&rdquo; . As of October 4, 2019, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which rates companies on governance
risk, gave our company a 10, its highest risk category, for the Governance QualityScore. Shareholders are encouraged to vote FOR
this good governance request to allow better shareholder oversight. Alphabet Opposing Statement Our Board of Directors believes
that the capital structure set out in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is in the best interests of the company
and our stockholders. Since its inception, Google has been managed with a focus on the long term. This focus was emphasized by
our Founders, Larry and Sergey, in their letter to our stockholders at the time of Google&rsquo;s initial public offering in 2004:
&ldquo;We are creating a corporate structure that is designed for stability over long time horizons.&rdquo; They reiterated their
commitment to our long-term focus in their April 2012 letter to our stockholders. The implementation of our holding company, Alphabet,
in October 2015 further reinforces this long-term view. The dual class capital structure with two classes of common stock (Class
A common stock with one (1) vote per share and Class B common stock with ten (10) votes per share) has been in existence since
we became a public company in 2004, and the tri-class structure, with a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital
stock), was approved by a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Every investor purchasing a share of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock is aware of this capital structure,
which is disclosed in detail in our public filings with the SEC, and many are attracted to our stock by the long-term stability
that our Founders and largest Class B stockholders, Larry and Sergey, continue to provide to the company.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">We believe that our success is owed in large part to the leadership
and vision provided by our Founders, Larry and Sergey. Through their leadership and focus on innovation and long-term growth, we
have established a track record of building a strong company and creating stockholder value. Larry and Sergey remain deeply committed
to Google and Alphabet for the long term, and are actively involved as Board members, stockholders, and Founders. We believe that
the stability provided by the tri-class voting structure gives us greater ability to focus on long-term interests than might otherwise
be the case. Further, we have established a robust governance structure to ensure independent oversight of the management team.
Since 2018, John L. Hennessy has served as our non-executive, independent Chairman. Our Board of Directors believes that he is
best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that our Board of Directors&rsquo; time and attention are focused on the most critical
matters for the company and its stockholders. His role enables decisive leadership and enhances accountability. Our Chairman, along
with the other independent members of our Board of Directors who together currently comprise more than 70% of our Board of Directors,
provide oversight of, and valuable guidance to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and our management team. As such, we believe our current
corporate governance structure is sound and effective. Our Board of Directors believes that our capital structure combined with
our governance structure has provided significant stability to the company, and is therefore in the best interests of our stockholders.

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Proposal Number 6 Stockholder Proposal Regarding Report on
Arbitration of Employment-Related Claims RESOLVED, that shareholders of Alphabet Inc. urge the Board of Directors to report to
shareholders, at reasonable cost and omitting confidential and proprietary information, on the use of contractual provisions requiring
direct and contract employees at Alphabet to arbitrate employment-related claims. The report should specify the proportion of the
workforce, subject to such provisions; the number of employment-related arbitration claims initiated and decided in favor of the
employee, in each case in the previous calendar year; and any changes in policy or practice Alphabet has made, or intends to make,
as a result of California&rsquo;s ban on agreeing to arbitration as a condition of employment. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Recently,
public attention has focused on companies&rsquo; use of agreements requiring employees to pursue employment-related claims, including
sexual harassment claims, through arbitration. High-profile sexual harassment cases involving Fox News, Google and Uber highlighted
the impact of these agreements. A robust public debate has ensued, including responses by legislators, regulators and state attorneys
general. Mandatory arbitration precludes employees from suing in court for wrongs like wage theft, discrimination and harassment,
and requires them to submit to private arbitration, which has been found to favor companies and discourage claims. In 2018, the
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Alphabet for sexual harassment (see https://www.eeoc.gov/ eeoc/newsroom/release/9-25-18c.cfm).
A bill to end mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims passed the U.S. House of Representatives in September 2019, and
56 state and territorial attorneys general voiced support for it. A 2019 article characterized the &ldquo;movement to end forced
arbitration&rdquo; as having &ldquo;swept Silicon Valley,&rdquo; with employee walk-outs and company policy changes (https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/
article/California-has-a-new-law-against-mandatory-14511832.php). California recently banned the practice of requiring arbitration
agreements as a condition of employment and Washington State enacted a law in 2018 invalidating contracts requiring arbitration
of sexual harassment or assault claims. Because arbitration is private and contractual, arbitrating employment-related claims can
allow a toxic culture to flourish, increasing the severity of eventual consequences and harming employee morale. Confidentiality
provisions can prevent an employee&rsquo;s lawyer from using knowledge of wrongdoing to identify other victims. In response to
a similar shareholder proposal in 2019, Alphabet refused to extend its ban on mandatory arbitration of employment claims enacted
at Google in February 2019 to other Alphabet-owned businesses, such as Verily, and to Google contract workers. The information
sought in this Proposal would allow shareholders to assess the proportion of the workforce subject to mandatory arbitration of
employment-related together with the risks posed by the use of such provisions. Our intent with respect to &ldquo;workforce&rdquo;
is similar to that of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in its UK Corporate Governance Code. According to the FRC, &ldquo;This
term has been carefully chosen to capture the complexity and diversity of modern contractual relationships between companies and
individuals undertaking work for them. The culture of the company, its strategy and values, and decisions made by the board and
senior management, will have impact on all those paid to work for the company (see https:// www.frc.org.uk/getattachment/31897789-cef6-48bb-aea9-f46b8cf80d02/Proposed-Revisions-to-the-UK-Corporate-Governance-
Code-Dec-2017-1.pdf). We urge shareholders to vote for this Proposal. Alphabet Opposing Statement Alphabet is committed to equality
and fairness. From that commitment comes our dedication to complying with all employment laws and ensuring that we maintain fair
employment practices throughout the company. But we have taken meaningful steps beyond those basic legal requirements. As of February
2019, Google no longer requires current or future employees to arbitrate any employment dispute, including, but not limited to,
sexual harassment and assault claims. We believe that arbitration can have a number of advantages compared to court proceedings
in resolving disputes quickly and fairly. Lawsuits are difficult for both sides, and arbitration is often faster and less expensive
than a lawsuit for all parties. However, there are differing views on when arbitration is appropriate, and Google&rsquo;s policy
change reflects that.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Proposal Number 7 Stockholder Proposal Regarding the Establishment
of Human Rights Risk Oversight Committee RESOLVED, shareholders request that Alphabet Inc. (&ldquo;Alphabet&rdquo; or &ldquo;the
Company&rdquo;) establish a Human Rights Risk Oversight Committee (&ldquo;the Committee&rdquo;) of the Board of Directors, composed
of independent directors with relevant experience. The Committee should provide an ongoing review of corporate policies and practices,
above and beyond legal and regulatory matters, to assess how Alphabet manages the current and potential impacts of the Company&rsquo;s
products and services on human rights, oversee the extent to which the Company is meeting international human rights responsibilities,
and offer guidance on strategic decisions. At its discretion, the Board should consider creating an advisory body of independent
subject matter experts to aid the Committee in its oversight responsibilities, publishing a formal charter for the Committee and
a summary of its functions, and directing the Committee to issue periodic reports. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: The 2011 United Nations
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (&ldquo;UNGPs&rdquo;) call on companies to undertake human rights due diligence
to identify, prevent, and mitigate the most severe risks to people in connection with their business. Global technology companies
bear unique responsibilities in this regard. The United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights stated, &ldquo;Digital technology
already delivers many benefits. Its value for human rights and development...is enormous...But we cannot ignore the dark side.
I cannot express it more strongly than this: The digital revolution is a major global human rights issue. Its unquestionable benefits
do not cancel out its unmistakable risks.&rdquo;1 This is especially true for Alphabet. Its technologies, products, and services
have transformed our daily lives and the global economy. However, they can pose human rights risks which endanger stakeholders
including customers, employees, suppliers, and broader communities. Examples include: . Proliferation digital surveillance by amassing
and in some cases, sharing sensitive user information, raising significant risks to privacy, which are heightened by the Company&rsquo;s
recent moves into health, location, and financial data;2 and . Exacerbating bias, reinforcing discrimination, or facilitating disinformation,
harassment, hate speech, incitements to violence through algorithms that show user-targeted content.3 Currently, Google&rsquo;s
Code of Conduct,4 applicable only to its own operations, and its Supplier Code of Conduct5 do mention certain human rights issues.
Yet Alphabet has not articulated an enterprise-wide commitment to respect human rights, and its governance structure has drawn
criticism for failing to adequately oversee broad human rights risks.6 While the Audit Committee has oversight authority over operation
infrastructure including data privacy,7 and the 2019 Proxy Statement noted that the Board provides &ldquo;Ongoing Monitoring of
Societal Impact,&rdquo;8 Proponents believe this patchwork is insufficient to holistically identify and address human rights issues,
leaving policy and due diligence gaps that expose Alphabet, its investors, and the individuals and communities it touches&mdash;to
human right risks. Consequently, greater Board oversight is imperative. Proponents believe that taking these steps would be in
the best interest of all stakeholders and encourage all shareholders to support this proposal. (1) https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=25158&amp;LangID=E

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Alphabet Opposing Statement Across Google, we are guided by
internationally recognized human rights standards. We are committed to respecting the rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and its implementing treaties, as well as upholding the standards established in the United Nations Guiding Principles
on Business and Human Rights and in the Global Network Initiative (GNI) Principles. Senior management oversees the implementation
of the human rights and GNI Principles at Google and provides quarterly updates to our Board of Directors on relevant issues. Dedicated
personnel are focused on product, jurisdiction, and functional areas and are responsible for the day-to-day operations of protecting
users and meeting Google&rsquo;s human rights obligations. Recent examples of Google&rsquo;s work on human rights issues include
developments in content quality policies and facial recognition applications. On content quality, one of the most complex and constantly
evolving areas we deal with is hate speech. In 2019, YouTube took a close look at its approach towards hateful content in consultation
with dozens of experts in subjects like violent extremism, supremacism, civil rights, and free speech. Based on those learnings,
YouTube made several updates to its hate speech policy including: removing more hateful and supremacist content, reducing borderline
content and raising up authoritative voices, and continuing to reward trusted creators and enforce monetization policies. Similarly,
our ongoing work on information integrity led to the release of a white paper in 2019 detailing our work to tackle the intentional
spread of disinformation &mdash; across Google Search, Google News, YouTube, and its advertising systems. As a leader in artificial
intelligence (AI), Google also publicly released AI principles that actively govern its research and product development and impact
its business decisions. In the AI principles, Google articulates that AI should (i) be socially beneficial; (ii) avoid creating
or reinforcing unfair bias; (iii) be built and tested for safety; (iv) be accountable to people; (v) incorporate privacy design
principles; (vi) uphold high standards of scientific excellence; and (vii) be made available for uses that accord with these principles.
The principles incorporate our human rights commitments, stating that we will not design or deploy AI technologies whose purpose
contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights. We are also committed to making responsible progress
in the development of AI and to sharing our knowledge, research, tools, datasets, and other resources with the larger community,
such as through the release of Google&rsquo;s Responsible AI Practices (https:// ai.google/education/responsible-ai-practices).
At Google, we have established an AI Principles review process that is designed to assess new projects, products, and deals, and
we embed human rights due diligence, including human rights impact assessments as appropriate, as part of that process. The review
structure is composed of a diverse and inclusive group of Googlers, including senior executives, user researchers, social scientists,
ethicists, human rights specialists, policy and privacy advisors, legal experts, and senior experts from a variety of other disciplines
(https://www.blog.google/technology/ai/google-ai-principles-updates-six-months/). In 2019, in collaboration with independent experts
using the UN&rsquo;s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as a framework, Google commissioned a formal human rights
impact assessment (HRIA) of the Celebrity Recognition tool and technology&rsquo;s potential impact on human rights. The HRIA played
an essential role in shaping the API&rsquo;s capabilities and the policies established around them and we publicly released a summary
of the HRIA. The current structure of our Board of Directors and its committees (Audit, Leadership Development and Compensation,
and Nominating and Corporate Governance) allows for regular assessments on a variety of topics, including the potential impacts
of our products and services on human rights. As described in Alphabet&rsquo;s Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board of Directors
has overall responsibility for risk oversight, specifically as it relates to the strategic, financial and execution risks and exposures
we face, including oversight of product innovation and policy matters, among others. Our Board of Directors takes this responsibility
very seriously. Consistent with these guidelines, we devote significant resources to ensure that we are aware of, and able to appropriately
address the various risks that our businesses face, including potential impacts our businesses may have on human rights. Our Board
of Directors, which has the ultimate responsibility of risk management and maintains robust oversight of these issues, empowers
and directs management as appropriate. The oversight performed by our Board of Directors and the relevant committees is also informed
by their discussions with management and, as authorized by Alphabet&rsquo;s Corporate Governance Guidelines and the respective
committee charters, external experts and advisors that they consider necessary or appropriate. As recent examples, our Audit Committee
has considered topics related to human rights, including our ongoing work to address harmful content, our ongoing commitment to
privacy across all our product areas, and our investments in affordable housing, among others. Our Audit Committee has also considered
topics related to environmental sustainability, and we have publicly reported our efforts in this space, such as our commitment
to ensure a sustainable future for all https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/ sustainability/our-commitment-ensure-sustainable-future-all/).
Our Leadership Development and Compensation Committee has considered topics such as gender pay equity and the broader inclusion
of underrepresented groups in technology, including initiatives to help address the underrepresentation. As a result, Google&rsquo;s
Objectives and Key Results for 2020 include a focus on advancing a diverse, accessible, and inclusive Google.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Our governance structure empowers our Board of Directors and
its committees to holistically review our business and to consider a wide range of risks, including the impact of our products
and services on human rights, among others. Further, our Board of Directors and management have already addressed several key concerns
the proposal raises through existing robust systems, structures, processes, and controls, with the Board of Directors and management
providing significant oversight. Establishing a separate committee to consider risks already considered by the Board of Directors
and its existing committees would result in a duplication of efforts with no incremental benefit to stockholders or any stakeholders.
Consequently, our Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote &ldquo;AGAINST&rdquo; this proposal. Required Vote Approval
of the stockholder proposal requires the affirmative &ldquo;FOR&rdquo; vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of
Alphabet&rsquo;s shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Proposal Number 8 Stockholder Proposal Regarding Non-Binding
Vote on Bylaw Amendments Proposal 8 &mdash; Let Shareholders Vote on Bylaw Amendments Shareholders request that the Board of Directors
take the steps necessary to amend the bylaws to require that any material amendment to bylaws, that is approved by the board, shall
be subject to a non-binding shareholder vote as soon as reasonably possible unless such amendment is already subject to a shareholder
vote. The Board of Directors or the Chairman of the Governance Committee would have the discretion to determine which bylaw amendments
are material. It is important that bylaw amendments take into consideration the impact that such amendments can have on limiting
the rights of shareholders and/or on reducing the accountability of directors and managers. For example, Directors could adopt
a narrowly crafted exclusive forum bylaw to suit the unique circumstances facing our directors. A proxy advisor recently adopted
a policy to vote against directors who unilaterally adopt bylaw provisions or amendments to the articles of incorporation that
materially diminish shareholder rights. Even if a majority of shareholders do not vote for this proposal it will at least alert
shareholders that management at this company, or the management at other companies in their portfolios, can try to sneak items
into the bylaws that limit the rights of shareholders and/or reduce the accountability of management. Once of the purposes of a
shareholder proposal like this is to provide useful information to shareholders that they would never receive from management.
Our directors could be neutral on this proposal to obtain feedback from shareholders without interference. If our directors are
opposed to this form of shareholder engagement then it would be useful for our directors to give recent examples of companies whose
directors took a leadership role and adopted bylaws that primarily benefited shareholders. Please vote yes: Let Shareholders Vote
on Bylaw Amendments &mdash; Proposal 8 Alphabet Opposing Statement Section 109 of Delaware&rsquo;s General Corporation Law (where
Alphabet is incorporated) already permits stockholders to unilaterally and independently adopt, amend, or repeal the bylaws of
a corporation. Section 109 also provides that the grant of concurrent power to the board of directors to adopt, amend, or repeal
the bylaws of a corporation shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend, or repeal bylaws.
Consistent with Section 109 of the Delaware General Corporation law, Article X of our Amended and Restated Bylaws states: &ldquo;The
bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by a majority of the voting power of the stockholders entitled to
vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its Certificate, also confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon
the Board. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the Board shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit
their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.&rdquo; In addition, our corporate governance structure already provides stockholders
with meaningful opportunities to express their levels of satisfaction with actions taken by our Board of Directors and implementing
this proposal could impede the ability of our Board of Directors to swiftly carry out their fiduciary duties as well as impose
undue administrative and financial burdens on the Company to solicit non-binding stockholder votes. The proposed Bylaw would also
not afford the Board of Directors any discretion to determine whether the submission of a board-approved bylaw amendment to a non-binding
stockholder vote is appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and, by extension, whether the Company
should invest the time and expense to take such action. Stockholders may contact our Board of Directors on bona fide issues, including
any concerns related to any amendments to our Amended and Restated Bylaws that are adopted by our Board of Directors. Stockholders
may also express their satisfaction with actions taken by our Board of Directors through their votes on director nominees. Our
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee closely monitors and takes into consideration the vote tallies at each annual meeting,
and considers stockholder sentiment on the suitability of a director continuing to serve on the Board of Directors. Stockholders
who are truly dissatisfied with incumbent directors and actions they may have taken are also empowered by our Amended and Restated
Bylaws to nominate or recommend candidates for election to our Board of Directors.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Proposal Number 9 Stockholder Proposal Regarding Report on
Sustainability Metrics WHEREAS: Studies suggest that companies that integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors
into business strategy reduce reputational, legal, and regulatory risks and improve long-term performance. Leading companies have
integrated sustainability metrics into executive pay plans, among them Unilever and Walmart. The UN Principles for Responsible
Investment (2012) state that considering ESG factors in compensation can help protect long-term shareholder value. Diversity, inclusion,
and equity are key components of business sustainability and success: . McKinsey research shows that companies in the top quartiles
for gender and racial/ethnic diversity were more likely to have above- average financial returns (&ldquo;Diversity Matters,&rdquo;
McKinsey &amp; Company, 2015). . In a 2013 Catalyst report, diversity was positively associated with more customers, increased
sales revenue, and greater relative profits. Yet technology companies have not seized this opportunity. Underrepresented people
of color hold just 9 percent of technical roles in the sector (Intel/Dalberg, 2016). Women hold 36 percent of entry-level tech
jobs and just 19 percent of C-suite positions (&ldquo;Women in the Workplace,&rdquo; McKinsey, 2016). The tech diversity crisis
threatens worker safety, talent retention, product development, and customer service. These human capital risks are playing out
as controversies and employee unrest at Alphabet: . In 2018, approximately 20,000 workers walked out protesting Alphabet&rsquo;s
mishandling of sexual misconduct cases. . In 2019, &ldquo;more than 2,000 Googlers &hellip; signed a petition to remove a member
of the company&rsquo;s newly formed council on artificial intelligence ethics for alleged anti-trans and anti-immigrant views.
The board was disbanded after only a week, in response to the outcry.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Google loses diversity chief amid unrest over
workplace issues,&rdquo; CNET, April 2019) Alphabet has taken steps to address inclusion, but risks remain as our Company remains
predominantly white and male. According to Google&rsquo;s 2019 diversity report, underrepresented people of color account for only
7.3 percent of Google&rsquo;s tech workforce and only 6.6. percent of leadership. In contrast, Silicon Valley&rsquo;s lower-wage
subcontracted workforce (e.g. janitors, cafeteria workers, shuttle drivers) is 58 percent Black or Latinx, earning on average $19,900
yearly (UC Santa Cruz, 2016) and often facing housing instability. Investors seek clarity regarding how Alphabet drives improvement
and how that strategy is supported by executive accountability. Clearly disclosed, comprehensive links among sustainability, diversity,
and executive compensation would enhance Alphabet&rsquo;s approach. Peers such as Microsoft, Intel, and IBM have set diversity
goals and begun linking parts of compensation to such goals. Alphabet should consider changing to keep pace with leaders and to
strengthen human capital management. RESOLVED: Shareholders request the Board Compensation Committee prepare a report assessing
the feasibility of integrating sustainability metrics, including metrics regarding diversity among senior executives, into performance
measures or vesting conditions that may apply to senior executives under the Company&rsquo;s compensation plans or arrangements.
For the purposes of this proposal, &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; is defined as how environmental and social considerations, and
related financial impacts, are integrated into long-term corporate strategy, and &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; refers to gender, racial,
and ethnic diversity. Alphabet Opposing Statement Our Board of Directors has carefully considered this proposal and, for the reasons
set forth below, does not believe that it is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders. Alphabet has long supported
corporate sustainability, including environmental, social, and diversity considerations. Alphabet builds sustainability into everything
it does from designing and operating efficient data centers, advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, building
better devices and services, empowering users with technology, and enabling a responsible supply chain. Google has been carbon
neutral since 2007 and in September 2019, announced it had made the largest corporate purchase of renewable energy in the world.
In 2018, for the second consecutive year, Google matched 100% of our electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases, as
reported in its 2019 Environmental Report (https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google_2019- environmental-report.pdf).</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Some other 2019 highlights and achievements include: &bull;We
made our largest corporate purchase of renewable energy: 18 new energy deals totaling 1,600 megawatts, which is anticipated to
spur the construction of more than $2 billion in new energy infrastructure. &bull;100% of Nest products launched in 2019 include
recycled plastic content and we launched carbon neutral shipping for Google&rsquo;s direct customers who buy a product on Google
Shopping or purchase Made by Google hardware. &bull;The Environmental Insights Explorer is enabling municipalities &mdash; which
represent more than 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions according to the 2016 United Nations Habitat World Cities Report &mdash;
to estimate emissions and develop climate action plans. In 2019, we expanded this tool to more than 100 cities worldwide. An overview
of Google&rsquo;s corporate environmental sustainability efforts can be found at https://google.com/sustainability, along with
our 2019 Environmental Report, which summarizes the progress of our environmental initiatives. For diversity, key goals include
extending diversity and inclusion, increasing transparency of data on workforce representation, and taking a more systemic approach
to improve outcomes in workforce representation and to create an inclusive culture. We are focused on measurable goals, talent
development, and building an inclusive culture because we believe only a holistic approach to diversity will produce meaningful,
sustainable change. We report attrition data externally and we are using this data to help inform how we approach our diversity
and inclusion efforts. To achieve these goals, Google has built a strategy anchored in further operationalizing its longstanding
commitment to equity, diversity, inclusion, and integrity. For example, one of our goals is to engage with aspiring technologists
early and often &mdash; ensuring that anyone can see themselves in technology and can make that future a reality. In the summer
of 2019, we hosted our 20th intern class &mdash; and it was our most representative in history. More information on Google&rsquo;s
diversity efforts can be found at https://google.com/diversity. Further, in assessing the individual performance of our named executive
officers, their performance against these types of strategic goals are considered by the Leadership Development and Compensation
Committee. Additionally, Google has renewed its commitment to pay and opportunity equity, including no longer requiring arbitration
for employment disputes, including but not limited to, sexual harassment and assault claims, for current or future Google employees.
As noted above, we are committed to incorporating these values into our business and have promoted them in our practices. Accordingly,
our Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote &ldquo;AGAINST&rdquo; this proposal. Required Vote Approval of the stockholder
proposal requires the affirmative &ldquo;FOR&rdquo; vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of Alphabet&rsquo;s shares

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Proposal Number 10 Stockholder Proposal Regarding Report on
Takedown Requests RESOLVED, shareholders request the Board of Directors issue a report (within a reasonable time frame, at reasonable
cost, and excluding confidential information) assessing the feasibility of public disclosing on an annual basis, by jurisdiction,
the list of delisted, censored, downgraded, proactively penalized, or blacklisted terms, queries or sites that the company implements
in response to government requests. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: Google&rsquo;s Artificial Intelligence Principles state the company will
not pursue technologies that cause harm, &ldquo;that gather or use information for surveillance&rdquo; or &ldquo;whose purpose
contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.&rdquo; There is increasing evidence of a contradiction
between Google&rsquo;s principles and its actions. Bu&bull;feed reported: &ldquo;According to Google&rsquo;s own stats, the Russian
government has made 175 separate requests for the search engine to remove sites it has banned, totally more than 160,000 separate
URLS...About 80% of the total requests...resulted in removal.&rdquo; PEN America said: &ldquo;we need far more transparency regarding
which sites Google has removed from its search results, as well as the internal evaluation and criteria that Google used for determining
whether these sites should be taken down.&rdquo; ARTICLE 19 submitted expert opinion to Russia&rsquo;s Constitutional Court regarding
the removal of articles on hate crimes from Google search, saying &ldquo;search engine operators are prohibited by the Law from
disclosing any information pertaining to the applicant&rsquo;s request...this constitutes a disproportionate restriction on the
right to freedom of expression&hellip; and a breach of their rights to a fair trial and to an effective remedy.&rdquo; In addition,
reports of proposed amendments to India&rsquo;s Information Technology Act indicate that it may soon be mandatory for firms like
Alphabet to proactively deploy technology to suppress content. Google states its Transparency Reports &ldquo;provide a glimpse
at the wide range of content removal requests that we receive, but they are not comprehensive.&rdquo; In 2018, the United Nations
Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression&rsquo;s report stated: &ldquo;the authoritative global standard for ensuring freedom
of expression on [companies&rsquo;] platforms is human rights law, not the varying laws of States or their own private interests,
and [companies] should re-evaluate their content standards accordingly.&rdquo; Proponents suggest the report assess the feasibility
of: &bull;Incorporating into Google&rsquo;s Transparency Report the substantive content of government requests, including whether
the request was met, and criteria used to guide decisions; &bull;Notifying customers of content affected by government requests.
Alphabet Opposing Statement Since our founding, Google has been committed to making the world&rsquo;s information available to
everyone. We believe that knowledge is empowering and that a society with more information is better off than one with less. Providing
access to information to people around the world is central to our mission. In 2010, we launched the Google Transparency Report
with the mission of sharing data that sheds light on how the policies and actions of governments and corporations affect privacy,
security, and access to information. Under the &ldquo;Government requests to remove content&rdquo; section of the report, we voluntarily
disclose the number of requests we receive from courts and government agencies in six-month periods. Further, we organize the requests
and items by reason given for removal request, type of Google product, and whether the requesting government body was a member
of the judicial or executive branch. We also provide this information on a country/regional basis. The Transparency Report is available
in full at https://transparencyreport.google.com/?hl=en, and the &ldquo;Government requests to remove content&rdquo; section can
be found at https://transparencyreport.google.com/government-removals/ overview?hl=en. Additionally, we provide transparency about
removals via Lumen, a project of Harvard University&rsquo;s Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society. Lumen works with a variety
of international research partners to offer information about the global landscape of Internet takedown requests. Lumen posts and
analyzes different kinds of requests to remove material from the Internet, including requests based on copyright claims. Lumen
receives these requests from participating companies as well as from individuals. When we are able to do so legally, Google links
from our search results to the requests published by Lumen in place of removed content. More information about Lumen can be found
at https://www.lumendatabase.org/.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">We also continue to innovate around product-specific transparency
with YouTube&rsquo;s industry-leading transparency reporting on how it enforces the Community Guidelines (https://www.youtube.com/about/policies/#community-guidelines).
We have always used a mix of human reviewers and technology to address violative content on our platform, and in 2017 we started
applying more advanced machine learning technology to flag content for review by our teams. This combination of smart detection
technology and highly- trained human reviewers has enabled YouTube to consistently enforce policies with increasing speed. We are
committed to tackling the challenge of quickly removing content that violates our Community Guidelines and reporting on our progress.
That is why in April 2018 we launched a quarterly YouTube Community Guidelines Enforcement Report (https://transparencyreport.google.com/youtube-policy/removals).
As part of this ongoing commitment to transparency, we expanded the report to include additional data like channel removals, the
number of comments removed, the policy reason why a video or channel was removed -- and most recently, appeals data. Each quarter
we may see these numbers fluctuate, especially when our teams tighten our policies or enforcement on a certain category to remove
more content. Given the significant work that we have done in this area, our public reporting of these issues, and our commitment
to continue to keep the public informed about our efforts, our Board of Directors does not believe that implementing this proposal
would provide additional benefit to our stockholders. Accordingly, our Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote &ldquo;AGAINST&rdquo;

elections, that is, when the number of director nominees exceeds the number of board seats. This proposal includes that a director
who receives less than a majority vote be removed as soon as a replacement director can be qualified on an expedited basis. If
such a director has key experience, they can transition to being a consultant or a director emeritus. With written justification,
the board can set an effective date several years into the future for these changes to take effect. SUPPORTING STATEMENT: To provide
shareholders a meaningful role in director elections, our Company&rsquo;s current director election standard should transition
from a plurality vote standard to a majority vote standard when only board nominated candidates are on the ballot. Under our Company&rsquo;s
current voting system, a director can be elected if all shareholders oppose the director but one shareholder votes FOR, even by
mistake. More than 90% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 have adopted majority voting for uncontested elections, as have almost
70% of the S&amp;P 1500. In 2019 majority shares voted FOR similar proposals at Stemline Therapeutics, Eldorado Resorts, RadNet,
New Media Investment Group, New Residential Investment Group, Safety Insurance Group, First Community Bancshares, GreenHill &amp;
Co., and Advaxis. During 2018 majority shares voted FOR similar proposals at Netflix, Marriott International, Discover Financial
Services, The Manitowoc Company, Costco Wholesale. BlackRock&rsquo;s proxy voting guidelines include the following: &ldquo;Majority
voting standards assist in ensuring that directors who are not broadly supported by shareholders are not elected to serve as their
representatives.&rdquo; Many of our other large shareholders have similar proxy voting policies. Alphabet operates like a dictatorship.
Under our company&rsquo;s multi-class voting structure, each share of Class A common stock has one vote. Each share of Class B
common stock has 10 votes. Founders control over 51% of voting power, while owning less than 13% of Alphabet stock. This should
also be seen in the context that Alphabet has yet to transition from a multiclass share structure and shareholders have no right
to act by written consent or to proxy access to nominate directors. Additionally, a supermajority vote is required to amend certain
bylaws. Our Board is locked into an outdated governance structure that reduces board accountability to shareholders. How we elect
directors is just one of many needed reforms. Please vote FOR. Elect Directors by Majority Vote &mdash; Proposal 11 Alphabet Opposing
Statement Our Board of Directors has considered this proposal and believes that the voting procedures set forth in our bylaws,
last amended and restated in October 2015, are in the best interests of Alphabet and our stockholders. Under our bylaws, directors
are elected using a plurality voting standard. Alphabet&rsquo;s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is tasked with evaluating
and recommending nominees for election to our Board of Directors. As part of the practice, Alphabet&rsquo;s Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee reviews and considers individual director performance, Board and committee performance, governance practices,
and stockholder approval before making recommendations to the Board of Directors. Stockholders can currently express dissatisfaction
with an incumbent director&rsquo;s performance by withholding their vote. Alphabet&rsquo;s Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee also closely monitors and takes into consideration the vote tallies at each annual meeting, and considers seriously stockholder
sentiment on the suitability of a director continuing to serve on the Board of Directors. Stockholders who are truly dissatisfied
with incumbent directors are empowered by our bylaws to nominate or recommend candidates for elections to our board. A plurality
voting standard for the election of directors is the default standard under Delaware law. It assures that we avoid &ldquo;failed
elections&rdquo; (scenarios where directors fail to achieve the votes necessary to be elected, resulting in vacancies on our Board).
The possibility of failed elections introduces unnecessary legal uncertainty and risk to our director election process as vacancies
on our Board of Directors could result in our inability to comply with certain NASDAQ listing requirements or other securities
regulations. This includes regulations related to director independence, committee composition, and the maintenance of an audit
committee financial expert.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Proposal Number 12 Stockholder Proposal Regarding Report on
Gender/Racial Pay Equity Gender/Racial Pay Equity WHEREAS: The World Economic Forum estimates the gender pay gap costs the economy
1.2 trillion dollars annually. The median income for women working full time in the United States is 80 percent of that of men.
This disparity can equal nearly half a million dollars over a career. Intersecting race, the gap for African American and Latina
women is 60 percent and 55 percent. At the current rate, women overall will not reach pay parity until 2059, African American women
until 2130, and Latina women until 2224. Research suggests gender diverse leadership leads to superior stock price performance
and return on equity. McKinsey states, &ldquo;the business case for the advancement and promotion of women is compelling.&rdquo;
Best practices include &ldquo;tracking and eliminating gender pay gaps.&rdquo; Women account for 31.6 percent of Google&rsquo;s
global workforce, but 26.1 percent of leadership. Actively managing pay equity &ldquo;is associated with higher current female
representation at the professional through executive levels and a faster trajectory to improved representation.&rdquo; Assessing
if a company has pay gaps requires analyzing both equal pay and equal opportunity. This is done using adjusted and unadjusted (median)
pay data. The objective of this proposal&mdash;median pay gap disclosure&mdash;addresses the structural bias affecting the jobs
women and minorities hold, when white men hold most higher paying jobs. It is the key metric used by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, World Economic Forum, and United States Department of Labor. United States companies have begun reporting
statistically adjusted equal pay for equal work numbers, assessing the pay of men and women performing similar jobs, minorities
and non-minorities, performing similar jobs, but ignore unadjusted median pay gaps. Google reports that for 91 percent of Googlers
there are 0 statistically significant pay differences across gender and race on an equal pay basis. Yet, that adjusted number is
only half the story, failing to consider how discrimination affects opportunity. The United Kingdom mandates disclosure of median
gender pay gaps. Google reported a 20 percent median base pay gap and a 30 percent median bonus pay gap for its United Kingdom
operations, but has not published its global median information. Public policy risk is of concern. The Paycheck Fairness Act pends
before the United States Congress. California, Massachusetts, New York, and Maryland have strengthened pay legislation. The Congressional
Joint Economic Committee reports 40 percent of the wage gap may be attributed to discrimination. RESOLVED: Shareholders request
Alphabet/Google report on the company&rsquo;s global median gender/racial pay gap, including associated policy, reputational, competitive,
and operational risks, and risks related to recruiting and retaining diverse talent. The report should be prepared at reasonable
cost, omitting proprietary information, litigation strategy and legal compliance information. The gender pay gap is defined as
the difference between male and female median earnings expressed as a percentage of male earnings (Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development). SUPPORTING STATEMENT: A report adequate for investors to assess company strategy and performance would include
the percentage global median pay gap between male and female employees across race and ethnicity, including base, bonus and equity
compensation. Alphabet Opposing Statement Our Board of Directors has carefully considered this proposal and, for the reasons set
forth below, does not believe that it is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. We are deeply committed to
diversity and equality in all areas of our business, including hiring and compensation. Consistent with those values, the compensation
structure at Google is designed to be fair and equitable and prevent pay differences across demographics for Google employees performing
the same work. Employee compensation is determined using formulas that are predicated on work-related inputs such as market rate,
location, level, and performance rating. Managers may apply discretion to adjust a given employee&rsquo;s modeled compensation
but must provide a clear justification and rationale. As a final check on its compensation processes, Google conducts an annual
pay equity analysis to identify any statistically significant discrepancies in compensation across demographic groups. Specifically,
we looked for pay</P>

worldwide) and, in the U.S., by race/ethnicity. We run our analyses at the job code level, adjusting for job function and level.
Google has released an annual report on its pay equity analyses every year since 2016. The latest annual pay equity review was
released on December 9, 2019 and can be found on the external Keyword site (https://www.blog.google/inside-google/working-google/our-
annual-pay-equity-review/). This report included Google&rsquo;s detailed methodology and findings. If Google finds any statistically
significant discrepancies in any job groups, Google makes upwards adjustments across the group to eliminate the discrepancy. In
2019, Google included 93% of its employees in the analysis, the highest percentage to date, and provided $5.1 million in adjustments.
Google&rsquo;s pay equity analysis ensures that compensation is fair for employees in the same job, at the same location, level,
and performance. We believe in the transparency of the process and will continue to disclose the results of our pay equity analyses,
consistent with our commitment to paying fairly, improving our practices, working hard to improve the representation across all
jobs and levels, and ensuring that Google is a great place to work for everyone. We are committed to a set of goals to increase
workforce representation and to create a more inclusive culture. Google&rsquo;s latest progress towards a more representative workforce
can be found in its 2019 Diversity Annual Report (https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/diversity.google/en//static/pdf/Google_diversity_annual_
report_2019.pdf). Accordingly, our Board of Directors does not believe that an additional report as detailed in the proposal above

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Proposal Number 13 Stockholder Proposal Regarding the Nomination
of Human Rights and/or Civil Rights Expert to Board Human/Civil Rights Expert on Board RESOLVED: Shareholders request that Alphabet&rsquo;s
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee nominate for the next Board election at least one candidate who: .. has a high level
of human and/or civil rights expertise and experience and is widely recognized as such, as reasonably determined by Alphabet&rsquo;s
Board, and .. will qualify as an independent director within the meaning of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.
WHEREAS: Shareholders believe Alphabet requires expert, board level oversight of civil and human rights issues to assess risk and
develop strategy to avoid causing or contributing to widespread violations of human or civil rights, such as supporting hate campaigns,
privacy violations, or violence. Alphabet has extraordinary impact on human rights, controlling an estimated 90 percent of the
global search market. Nearly two billion people use YouTube monthly, with YouTube&rsquo;s recommendation algorithm driving approximately
70 percent of viewing. Shareholders are concerned Alphabet&rsquo;s content governance has proven ad hoc, ineffectual, and poses
risk to shareholder value. Civil rights advocates have criticized Alphabet for failing to address hate speech that targets marginalized
groups. The Anti-Defamation League found &ldquo;a significant number of channels on YouTube&rsquo;s platform continue to disseminate
anti-Semitic and white supremacist content despite the company&rsquo;s June 2019 crackdown on hate speech.&rdquo; The Christchurch
terrorist attack in New Zealand, broadcast on YouTube, led to a global call to limit the spread of extremist content. Prime Minister
Jacinda Ardern said: &ldquo;We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them
is not the responsibility of the place where they are published...It cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility.&rdquo;
In 2019, nearly 1500 employees &ndash; Googlers for Human Rights &ndash; petitioned Google to commit &ldquo;not to support CBP,
ICE, or ORR with any infrastructure, funding, or engineering resources, directly or indirectly, until they stop engaging in human
rights abuses&rdquo;, comparing Google&rsquo;s role today to IBM&rsquo;s role to enabling Nazis during the Holocaust. A 2019 Amnesty
International report concluded Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;surveillance-based business model is incompatible with the right to privacy
and poses a serious threat to a range of other human rights.&rdquo; The report said algorithms &ldquo;can result in Google...actively
promoting or amplifying abusive, discriminatory or hateful content.&rdquo; Google was fined a record 170 million dollars by the
Federal Trade Commission and New York Attorney General Letitia James over YouTube&rsquo;s violation of children&rsquo;s privacy.
James said: &ldquo;Google and YouTube knowingly and illegally monitored, tracked and served targeted ads to young children just
to keep advertising dollars rolling in. These companies put children at risk and abused their power.&rdquo; As fiduciaries, our
Board is responsible for stewardship of business performance and long term strategic planning, in light of risk factors like widespread
violations of human and civil rights. Ranking Digital Rights reported Google has &ldquo;continued to lag behind its peers for weak
governance and oversight over its impact on human rights, including freedom of expression and privacy.&rdquo; Alphabet Opposing
Statement Across Google, we are guided by internationally recognized human rights standards. We are committed to respecting the
rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its implementing treaties, as well as upholding the standards
established in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and in the Global Network Initiative (GNI) Principles.
Dedicated personnel are focused on product, jurisdiction, and functional areas and are responsible for the day-to-day operations
of protecting users and meeting Google&rsquo;s human rights obligations. Senior management oversees the implementation of the human
rights and GNI Principles at Google and provides quarterly updates on relevant issues to the members of our Board of Directors,
who we believe are qualified and equipped to represent the best interests of our stockholders and to provide practical insights
and diverse perspectives, including on topics such as those related to civil and/or human rights.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">As we describe in more detail in the Director Selection Process
and Qualifications section beginning on page 27 of this proxy statement, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses
a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for directors balancing the appropriate size and composition of the
Board of Directors and its respective committees with the qualifications of candidates in light of these needs. The Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee factors into its determination the following qualities, among others: integrity, professional
reputation and strength of character, educational background, knowledge of our business, diversity of professional experience,
including whether the person is a current or former chief executive officer or chief financial officer of a public company or the
head of a division of a large international organization, and ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders. Most
of our directors also have experience serving on boards of directors and board committees of other public companies, and have an
understanding of corporate governance practices and trends, different business processes, challenges, and strategies. Other directors
have experience as presidents or trustees of significant academic, research, and philanthropic institutions, which also brings
unique perspectives to the Board. Further, our directors also have other experience that makes them valuable members, such as entrepreneurial
experience and experience developing technology or managing technology companies, which provides insight into strategic and operational
issues faced by us. We believe there are a myriad of skills that make an ideal board candidate, including factors such as civil
and/or human rights experience. Our current process allows us to consider all of these factors holistically and as a result, we
do not believe it would be in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders to adopt this proposal. Therefore, our Board
of Directors recommends that stockholders vote &ldquo;AGAINST&rdquo; this proposal. Required Vote Approval of the stockholder proposal

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Proposal Number 14 Stockholder Proposal Regarding Report on
Whistleblower Policies and Practices WHEREAS, Alphabet may face business risks related to employee morale and user trust due to
insufficient protection for employees voicing ethical and human rights concerns regarding company practices. Resourcing whistleblower
protections is vital to a well-functioning system. For example, the U.S. Department of Labor has reported a major problem with
whistleblower protections is the &ldquo;lack of resources and proper tracking of complaints, as well as a complicated patchwork
of regulations that aim to protect whistleblowers.&rdquo; And according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
&ldquo;A non-retaliation policy alone, without a system to ensure its respect (such as disciplinary action against those who retaliate),
is unlikely to encourage reporting.&rdquo; Furthermore, a specific focus on protecting human rights is a necessary component of
a system of strong whistleblower protections. A United Nations Report on whistleblower protection recommended: &ldquo;Disclosure
of human rights or humanitarian law violations should never be the basis of penalties of any kind.&rdquo; A 2018 letter from fourteen
human rights groups urged Google to &ldquo;Guarantee protections for whistle-blowers and other employees speaking out where they
see the company is failing its commitments to human rights.&rdquo; New York University&rsquo;s Al Now recommended companies &ldquo;provide
protections for conscientious objectors, employee organizing, and ethical whistleblowers.&rdquo; In October 2019, the European
Union adopted a rule to protect whistleblowers in several new areas, including privacy and data protection. This topic is one that
Alphabet is currently grappling with. In 2017, Google asked the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to overturn a policy that
allowed workers to organize on company systems and prevented companies from retaliating; in 2019, as part of a settlement agreement
with NLRB, Google must tell workers they will not be retaliated against for exercising their rights. In November 2019, employees
protested actions of the company&rsquo;s investigations team, claiming it was illegal retaliation for organizing, violating the
NLRB settlement, and labeling Google&rsquo;s actions &ldquo;brute force intimidation.&rdquo; Google then reportedly fired workers
active in organizing, reportedly for violating data security policies. These controversies clearly touch on how the company is
addressing human rights issues. Reporting indicates that many of the employees who have resigned in a very public manner discussed
in their resignation letters retaliation and punishments related to speaking up about the ethics and human rights implications
of company projects and business &ndash; e.g. China, Project Maven, and other projects. A George Washington 2019 report found whistleblowing
report volume &ldquo;is associated with fewer and lower amounts of government fines and material lawsuits.&rdquo; RESOLVED, shareholders
request the Board of Directors to issue a report (within a reasonable time, at reasonable cost, and excluding confidential information)
evaluating the company&rsquo;s whistleblower policies and practices and assessing the feasibility of expanding those policies and
practices above and beyond current levels to cover, for example, information concerning the public interest and/ or information
concerning rights contained in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Alphabet Opposing Statement Alphabet is committed
to maintaining a culture that encourages employees and others to report concerns related to violations of our Code of Conduct,
policies, or laws, including our human rights commitments. That is why we have adopted and promoted policies that strictly prohibit
retaliation of any kind for raising such concerns or for participating in an investigation relating to such concerns. When we learn
about a potential violation of our policies or Code of Conduct, we look into the concern consistent with our robust process for
carefully investigating such allegations, and make appropriate remedial recommendations as a result of the investigation. Throughout
this process, we treat information, including the identity of the individuals raising the concern, as confidential as possible,
sharing only on a need to know basis. We also protect whistleblowers by thoroughly investigating allegations of retaliation and
imposing discipline when we substantiate retaliation allegations. And for the past six years, we have shared with our employees,
on an annual basis, an Internal Investigations Report, which provides transparency into the type of concerns employees have raised,
the number of concerns employees have raised, and how the Company has resolved those concerns. The ability to raise concerns helps
protect and preserve our Company&rsquo;s special culture and is key to our long-term success. We believe our existing policies,
which are broad in scope, adequately address the concerns raised by the proponent. Consequently, our Board of Directors recommends
that stockholders vote &ldquo;AGAINST&rdquo; this proposal.</P>

to you on the Internet, or, upon your request, has delivered printed proxy materials to you, in connection with the solicitation
of proxies for use at Alphabet&rsquo;s 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (Annual Meeting), which will take place on Wednesday,
June 3, 2020 at 9:00 a.m., Pacific Time, via our virtual meeting site at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/GOOGL20. You are invited
to participate in and vote on the items of business described in this proxy statement at the Annual Meeting if you were an Alphabet
Class A or Class B common stock holder as of the close of business on April 7, 2020, the Record Date for the Annual Meeting, or
hold a valid proxy for the Annual Meeting. This proxy statement includes information that we are required to provide to you under
the SEC rules and that is designed to assist you in voting your shares. 2. What is included in the proxy materials? The proxy materials
include: &bull;our proxy statement for the Annual Meeting; &bull;our Annual Report, which includes our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019; and &bull;the proxy card or a voting instruction form for the Annual Meeting. 3. What
information is contained in this proxy statement? The information in this proxy statement relates to the proposals to be voted
on at the Annual Meeting, the voting process, the compensation of our directors and certain of our executive officers, corporate
governance, and certain other required information. 4. Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability
of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? In accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, we may furnish proxy
materials, including this proxy statement and our Annual Report, to our stockholders by providing access to such documents on the
Internet instead of mailing printed copies. Most stockholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless they
request them. Instead, the Notice, which was mailed to the holders of Class A and Class B common stock, will instruct you as to
how you may access and review all of the proxy materials on the Internet. The Notice also instructs you as to how you may submit
your proxy on the Internet. If you would like to receive a paper or email copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions
for requesting such materials in the Notice.</P>

Annual Meeting on the Internet and vote your shares; and &bull;instruct us to send our future proxy materials to you electronically
by email. Our proxy materials are also available on our Investor Relations website at https://abc.xyz/investor/other/annual-meeting/.
Choosing to receive your future proxy materials by email will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you, and will
reduce the impact of printing and mailing these materials on the environment. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by
email, you will receive an email next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting
site. Your election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you revoke it. &mdash;&mdash;VOTING INFORMATION

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">9. What shares can I vote? Each share of Alphabet Class A common
stock and Class B common stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on April 7, 2020, the Record Date for the Annual
Meeting, is entitled to be voted on all items being voted on at the Annual Meeting. Holders of Alphabet Class C capital stock have
no voting power as to any items of business that will be voted on at the Annual Meeting. You may vote all shares of Alphabet Class
A common stock and Class B common stock that you owned as of the Record Date, including shares held: (1) directly in your name
as the stockholder of record, and (2) for you as the beneficial owner in street name through a broker, bank, trustee, or other
nominee. On the Record Date, we had 346,454,661 shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock issued and outstanding,
consisting of 300,047,170 shares of Class A common stock and 46,407,491 shares of Class B common stock. On the Record Date, we
had 337,145,956 shares of Class C capital stock issued and outstanding. 10. How many votes am I entitled to per share? Each holder
of shares of Alphabet Class A common stock is entitled to one (1) vote for each share of Class A common stock held as of the Record
Date, and each holder of shares of Alphabet Class B common stock is entitled to ten (10) votes for each share of Class B common
stock held as of the Record Date. The holders of the shares of Alphabet Class A common stock and Class B common stock are voting
as a single class on all matters described in this proxy statement for which your vote is being solicited. 11. What is the difference
between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? Most Alphabet stockholders hold their shares as a
beneficial owner through a broker or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some
distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially. &bull;Stockholder of Record&mdash;If your shares are registered
directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services (Computershare), you are considered, with respect
to those shares, the stockholder of record. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly
to Alphabet or to vote during the Annual Meeting. If you requested to receive printed proxy materials, you may use the proxy card
that was sent to you. You may also vote over the Internet, by telephone, or by mail as described in the Notice and under Question
13. &bull;Beneficial Owner&mdash;If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, trust, or other
similar organization, like the vast majority of our stockholders, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street
name, and the Notice was forwarded to you by that organization. As the beneficial owner, you may vote over the Internet, by telephone,
or by mail, as described in the Notice and under Question 13. You may also direct your broker, bank, trustee or nominee how to
vote your shares, and you may vote during the Annual Meeting. If you do not wish to vote during the Annual Meeting or you will
not be participating in the Annual Meeting, you may vote over the Internet, by telephone, or by mail, as described in the Notice
and under Question 13. 12. How can I vote my shares at the Annual Meeting? This proxy statement was first mailed to stockholders
on or about April 24, 2020. It is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Alphabet
to be voted during the Annual Meeting for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting. Participation in
the Annual Meeting is limited to holders of Class A or Class B common stock as of April 7, 2020. You will be able to participate
in, vote your shares electronically, and submit your questions during the Annual Meeting by visiting www. virtualshareholdermeeting.com/GOOGL20.
To be admitted to and to vote at the Annual Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting. com/GOOGL20, you must enter the 16-digit
control number found in the box marked by the arrow for postal mail recipients of the Notice or the proxy card, or within the body
of the email for electronic delivery recipients. If you encounter any technical difficulties accessing the Annual Meeting or during
the Annual Meeting, please call: (800) 586-1548 (toll-free) or (303) 562-9288 (international). Technical support will be available
30 minutes prior to the start time of the Annual Meeting. 13. How can I vote my shares without participating in the Annual Meeting?
Whether you hold shares directly as the stockholder of record or beneficially in street name, you may direct how your shares are
voted without participating in the Annual Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote by proxy over the Internet
by following the instructions provided in the Notice, or, if you requested to receive printed proxy materials, you can also vote
by mail or telephone pursuant to instructions provided on the proxy card.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">If you hold shares beneficially in street name, you may also
vote by proxy over the Internet by following the instructions provided in the Notice, or, if you requested to receive printed proxy
materials, you can also vote by telephone or mail by following the voting instruction form provided to you by your broker, bank,
trustee, or nominee. 14. Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy? You can change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before
it is exercised at the Annual Meeting by taking any one of the following actions: (i) follow the instructions given for changing
your vote via the Internet or by telephone or deliver a valid written proxy with a later date; (ii) notify Alphabet&rsquo;s Corporate
Secretary in writing that you have revoked your proxy by mail at Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043,
or (iii) vote electronically during the Annual Meeting through the Annual Meeting website. 15. Is my vote confidential? Proxy instructions,
ballots, and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy.
Your vote will not be disclosed either within Alphabet or to third parties, except: (1) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements,
(2) to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote, and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation.
Occasionally, stockholders provide on their proxy card written comments, which are then forwarded to Alphabet management. 16. How
many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the Annual Meeting? The quorum requirement for holding the Annual
Meeting and transacting business is that holders of a majority of the voting power of Alphabet&rsquo;s shares of Class A common
stock and Class B common stock outstanding as of the Record Date must be present or represented by proxy. Both abstentions and
broker non-votes (described below in Question 18) are counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 17. How
are votes counted? In the election of directors (Proposal Number 1), you may vote &ldquo;FOR&rdquo; all or some of the nominees
or your vote may be &ldquo;WITHHELD&rdquo; with respect to one or more of the nominees. For the other items of business, you may
vote &ldquo;FOR,&rdquo; &ldquo;AGAINST,&rdquo; or &ldquo;ABSTAIN.&rdquo; If you elect to &ldquo;ABSTAIN,&rdquo; the abstention
has the same effect as a vote &ldquo;AGAINST.&rdquo; If you provide specific instructions with regard to certain items, your shares
will be voted as you instruct on such items. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card or over the telephone
or Internet, the shares will be voted as recommended by our Board of Directors. 18. What is the voting requirement to approve each
of the proposals? In the election of directors, the eleven persons receiving the highest number of affirmative &ldquo;FOR&rdquo;
votes at the Annual Meeting will be elected. The approval of the remaining thirteen proposals in each case requires the affirmative
&ldquo;FOR&rdquo; vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of Alphabet&rsquo;s shares of Class A common stock and
Class B common stock represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.
If you hold shares beneficially in street name and do not provide your broker with voting instructions, your shares may constitute
&ldquo;broker non-votes.&rdquo; Broker non-votes occur on a matter when a broker is not permitted to vote on that matter without
instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions are not given. These matters are referred to as &ldquo;non-routine&rdquo;
matters. All of the matters scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting are &ldquo;non-routine,&rdquo; except for the proposal
to ratify the appointment of Ernst &amp; Young LLP as Alphabet&rsquo;s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2020. In tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal, shares that constitute broker non-votes
are not considered voting power present with respect to that proposal. Thus, broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any
matter being voted on at the Annual Meeting, assuming that a quorum is obtained.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">Abstentions are considered voting power present at the Annual
Meeting and thus will have the same effect as votes against each of the matters scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting
(other than the election of directors). Please note that since brokers may not vote your shares on &ldquo;non-routine&rdquo; matters,
including the election of directors (Proposal Number 1), the proposal to amend Alphabet&rsquo;s Amended and Restated 2012 Stock
Plan (Proposal Number 3), the proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, compensation awarded to named executive officers (Proposal
Number 4), and each of the stockholder proposals (Proposals Number 5 through Number 14), in the absence of your specific instructions,
we encourage you to provide instructions to your broker regarding the voting of your shares. 19. Is cumulative voting permitted
for the election of directors? No, you may not cumulate your votes for the election of directors. 20. Who will bear the cost of
soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting? Alphabet is making this solicitation and will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling,
printing, mailing, and distributing these proxy materials and soliciting votes. If you choose to access the proxy materials and/or
vote over the Internet, you are responsible for internet access charges you may incur. If you choose to vote by telephone, you
are responsible for telephone charges you may incur. In addition to the mailing of these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies
or votes may be made in person, by telephone, or by electronic communication by our directors, officers, and employees, who will
not receive any additional compensation for such solicitation activities. We have also retained Georgeson LLC to assist us in the
distribution of proxy materials. We will pay Georgeson LLC a fee of approximately $1,500 plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
for these services. 21. What happens if additional matters are presented at the Annual Meeting? Other than the fourteen items of
business described in this proxy statement, we are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. If you
grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders, Sundar Pichai, Ruth M. Porat, Kent Walker, and Kathryn W. Hall, or any of them,
will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If,
for any reason, any of the nominees is not available as a candidate for director, the persons named as proxy holders will vote
your proxy for such other candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board of Directors. 22. Where can I find the voting
results of the Annual Meeting? We will announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and publish final voting results
on the 2020 Annual Meeting section of our Investor Relations website at www.abc.xyz/investor/other/annual-meeting/. We will also
disclose the final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days of the Annual Meeting.

heirs, executors and administrators, as the case may be. (r) &ldquo;Person&rdquo; means a &ldquo;person&rdquo; as such term is
used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, including any &ldquo;group&rdquo; within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) under
the Exchange Act. (s) &ldquo;Plan&rdquo; means this 2012 Amended and Restated Stock Plan, as it may be amended from time to time.
(t) &ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo; means the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. (u) &ldquo;Stock Incentive Award&rdquo; means an
Option or Other Stock-Based Award granted pursuant to the terms of the Plan. (v) &ldquo;Subsidiary&rdquo; means any &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo;
within the meaning of Rule 405 under the Securities Act. 3. Stock Subject to the Plan and Limitations on Cash Incentive Awards
(a) Stock Subject to the Plan The maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that may be covered by Incentive Awards granted under
the Plan shall not exceed 96,500,000 shares of Capital Stock in the aggregate. The maximum number of shares of Capital Stock that
may be covered by Incentive Awards granted under the Plan that are intended to be ISOs shall not exceed 96,500,000 shares of Capital
Stock in the aggregate. The shares referred to in the preceding sentences of this paragraph shall be subject to adjustment as provided
in Section 9 and the following provisions of this Section 3. Shares of Capital Stock issued under the Plan may be either authorized
and unissued shares or treasury shares, or both, at the sole discretion of the Committee. For purposes of the preceding paragraph,
shares of Capital Stock covered by Incentive Awards shall only be counted as used to the extent they are actually issued and delivered
to a Participant (or such Participant&rsquo;s permitted transferees as described in the Plan) pursuant to the Plan. For purposes
of clarification, in accordance with the preceding sentence if an Incentive Award is settled for cash or if shares of Capital Stock
are withheld to pay the exercise price of an Option or to satisfy any tax withholding requirement in connection with an Incentive
Award, only the shares issued (if any), net of the shares withheld, will be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the number
of shares of Capital Stock that are available for delivery under the Plan. In addition, shares of Capital Stock related to Incentive
Awards that expire, are forfeited or cancelled or terminated for any reason without the issuance of shares shall not be treated
as issued pursuant to the Plan. In addition, if shares of Capital Stock owned by a Participant (or such Participant&rsquo;s permitted
transferees as described in the Plan) are tendered (either actually or through attestation) to the Company in payment of any obligation
in connection with an Incentive Award, the number of shares tendered shall be added to the number of shares of Capital Stock that
are available for delivery under the Plan. Shares of Capital Stock covered by Incentive Awards granted pursuant to the Plan in
connection with the conversion, replacement, or adjustment of outstanding equity-based awards to reflect a merger or acquisition
(within the meaning of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c) and Interpretive Material 5635-1) shall not count as used under the Plan for
purposes of this Section 3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, shares of Capital Stock attributable to Incentive
Awards transferred under any Incentive Award Transfer Program shall not again be available for delivery under the Plan. (b) Non-Employee
Director Awards In order to retain and compensate the non-employee members of the Board of Directors for their services, and to
strengthen the alignment of their interests with those of the stockholders of the Company, the Plan permits the grant of cash-based
and stock-based Awards to any non-employee member of the Board of Directors. Aggregate Awards granted to any non- employee member
of the Board of Directors in respect of any calendar year, solely with respect to his or her service as a</P>

$1,500,000 based on the aggregate value of cash-based Awards and the Fair Market Value of any stock-based Awards, in each case
determined as of the date of grant. The Board of Directors will reassess this cap at least once every five years. Non-employee
members of the Board of Directors shall not be eligible to receive any Incentive Awards other than Awards. 4. Administration of
the Plan The Plan shall be administered by a Committee of the Board of Directors consisting of two or more persons, each of whom
qualifies as a &ldquo;non-employee director&rdquo; (within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange
Act), and as &ldquo;independent&rdquo; within the meaning of any applicable stock exchange listing rules or similar regulatory
authority. The Committee shall, consistent with the terms of the Plan, from time to time designate those employees and consultants
of the Company and members of the Board of Directors who shall be granted Incentive Awards under the Plan and the amount, type
and other terms and conditions of such Incentive Awards. All of the powers and responsibilities of the Committee under the Plan
may be delegated by the Committee to any subcommittee thereof. In addition, the Committee may from time to time authorize a subcommittee
consisting of one or more members of the Board of Directors (including members who are employees of the Company) or employees of
the Company to grant Incentive Awards, subject to such restrictions and limitation as the Committee may specify and to the requirements
of Delaware General Corporation Law Section 157. The Committee shall have full discretionary authority to administer the Plan,
including discretionary authority to interpret and construe any and all provisions of the Plan and the terms of any Incentive Award
(and any agreement evidencing the grant of any Incentive Award) granted thereunder and to adopt and amend from time to time such
rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan as the Committee may deem necessary or appropriate. The Committee shall
have the authority, in its discretion, to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules
and regulations related to sub-plans established for the purpose of satisfying applicable foreign laws and/or qualifying for preferred
tax treatment under applicable foreign tax laws. For purposes of clarity, the Committee may exercise all discretion granted to
it under the Plan in a non-uniform manner among Participants. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the Committee
shall determine whether an authorized leave of absence, or absence in military or government service, shall constitute termination
of employment, provided that a Participant who is an employee will not be deemed to cease employment in the case of any leave of
absence approved by the Company. Unless the Committee provides otherwise in the agreement evidencing the grant of an Incentive
Award, vesting of Incentive Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence and will resume on the
date the Participant returns to work on a regular schedule as determined by the Company, it being understood that no vesting credit
will be awarded for the time vesting has been suspended during such leave of absence. For purposes of ISOs, no such leave may exceed
ninety (90) days, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon
expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then three months following the 91st day of such
leave any ISO held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an ISO and will be treated for tax purposes as a non-qualified
Option. The provisions of this paragraph shall be administered and interpreted in a manner that does not give rise to any tax under
Section 409A of the Code. The employment of a Participant with the Company shall be deemed to have terminated for all purposes
of the Plan if such Participant is employed by or provides services to a Person that is a Subsidiary of the Company and such Person
ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company, unless the Committee determines otherwise. The Committee may, without limitation and
in its discretion, in connection with any such determination, provide for the accelerated vesting of any Incentive Award upon or
after such cessation, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall specify. The employment of a Participant with
the Company shall not be deemed to have terminated for any purpose of the Plan if such Participant is employed by a Person that
is part of the Company, and such Participant&rsquo;s employment is subsequently transferred to any other Person that is part of
the Company, unless and to the extent the Committee specifies otherwise in writing in the instrument evidencing the grant of an
Incentive Award or otherwise. A Participant who ceases to be an employee of the Company but continues, or simultaneously commences,
services as a consultant or director of the Company shall not be deemed to have had a termination of employment for purposes of
the Plan, unless the Committee determines otherwise. Decisions of the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties.
All discretion granted to the Committee pursuant to this paragraph must be exercised in a manner that would not cause any tax to
become due under Section 409A of the Code. On or after the date of grant of an Incentive Award under the Plan, the Committee may
(i) accelerate the date on which any such Incentive Award becomes vested, exercisable or transferable, as the case may be, (ii)
extend the term of any such Incentive Award, including, without limitation, extending the period following a termination of a Participant&rsquo;s
employment during which any such Incentive Award may remain outstanding, (iii) waive any conditions to the vesting, exercisability
or transferability, as the case may be, of any such Incentive Award, or (iv) provide for the payment of dividends or dividend equivalents
with respect to any such Incentive Award; provided, that the Committee shall not have any such authority to the extent that the
grant of such authority would cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code. The Board of Directors or the Committee
may, at any time, in its sole and complete discretion, implement an Incentive Award Transfer Program.</P>

<p style="font: 1px Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin: 0pt 0; color: White">The Company shall pay any amount payable with respect to an
Incentive Award in accordance with the terms of such Incentive Award, provided that the Committee may, in its discretion, defer
the payment of amounts payable with respect to an Incentive Award subject to and in accordance with the terms of a Deferred Compensation
Plan. 5. Eligibility The Persons who shall be eligible to be selected by the Committee from time to time to receive Incentive Awards
pursuant to the Plan shall be those Persons (a) who are employees and consultants of, or who render services directly or indirectly
to, the Company or (b) who are members of the Board of Directors. Each Incentive Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced
by an instrument in writing in form and substance approved by the Committee. 6. Options The Committee may from time to time grant
Options, subject to the following terms and conditions: (a) Exercise Price The exercise price per share of Capital Stock covered
by any Option shall be not less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Capital Stock on the date on which such Option
is granted. (b) Term and Exercise of Options (i) Each Option shall become vested and exercisable on such date or dates, during
such period and for such number of shares of Capital Stock as shall be determined by the Committee on or after the date such Option
is granted and set forth in the agreement evidencing the grant of such Option; provided, however that no Option shall be exercisable
after the expiration of ten (10) years from the date such Option is granted; and, provided, further, that each Option shall be
subject to earlier termination, expiration or cancellation as provided in the Plan or in the agreement evidencing the grant of
such Option. (ii) Each Option may be exercised in whole or in part; provided, however that no partial exercise of an Option shall
be for an aggregate exercise price of less than $1,000. The partial exercise of an Option shall not cause the expiration, termination
or cancellation of the remaining portion thereof. (iii) An Option shall be exercised by such methods and procedures as the Committee
determines from time to time, including without limitation through net physical settlement or other method of cashless exercise.
(iv) Options may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or
by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of a Participant, only by the Participant; provided,
however, that the Committee may permit in its discretion Options to be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed
of, on a general or specific basis, subject to such conditions and limitations as the Committee may determine, including through
the implementation of an Incentive Award Transfer Program. (c) Effect of Termination of Employment or Other Relationship The agreement
evidencing the grant of each Option shall specify the consequences with respect to such Option of the termination of the employment
or other service between the Company and the Participant holding the Option. (d) Additional Terms for ISOs Each Option that is
intended to qualify as an ISO shall be designated as such in the agreement evidencing its grant, and each agreement evidencing
the grant of an Option that does not include any such designation shall be deemed to be a non-qualified Option. ISOs may only be
granted to Persons who are employees of the Company. The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date of grant of the
ISOs) of the number of shares of Capital Stock with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by any Participant
during any calendar year under all plans of the Company shall not exceed $100,000, or such other maximum amount as is then applicable
under Section 422 of the Code. Any Option or a portion thereof that is designated as an ISO that for any reason fails to meet the
requirements of an ISO shall be treated hereunder as a non-qualified Option. No ISO may be granted to a Person who, at the time
of the proposed grant, owns (or is deemed to own under the Code) stock possessing more than ten percent (10%) of the total combined
voting power of all classes of common stock of the Company unless (i) the exercise price of such ISO is at least one hundred ten
percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Capital Stock at the time such ISO is granted and (ii) such ISO is not exercisable
after the expiration of five years from the date it is granted. (e) Repricing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Alphabet may not reprice any Option without the approval of the stockholders of Alphabet. For this purpose, &ldquo;reprice&rdquo;
means (i) any of the following or any other action that has the same effect: (A) lowering the exercise price of an Option after
it is granted, (B) any other action that is treated as a repricing under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;),
or (C) cancelling an Option at a time when its exercise price exceeds the Fair Market Value</P>

guidance issued by the NASDAQ Stock Market. 7. Other Stock-Based Awards The Committee may grant equity-based or equity-related
awards not otherwise described herein in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions (including any performance conditions)
as the Committee shall determine. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, each such Other Stock-Based Award
may (a) involve the transfer of actual shares of Capital Stock to Participants, either at the time of grant or thereafter, or payment
in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of shares of Capital Stock, (b) be subject to performance-based and/or service-based
conditions, (c) be in the form of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance
shares, deferred share units or share-denominated performance units, and (d) be designed to comply with applicable laws of jurisdictions
other than the United States; provided, that each Other Stock-Based Award shall be denominated in, or shall have a value determined
by reference to, a number of shares of Capital Stock that is specified at the time of the grant of such award. 8. Cash Incentive
Awards The Committee may grant Cash Incentive Awards, subject to terms and conditions determined by the Committee in its sole discretion,
provided that such terms and conditions are consistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan. Cash Incentive Awards may be
settled in cash or in other property, including shares of Capital Stock, provided that the term &ldquo;Cash Incentive Award&rdquo;
shall exclude any Stock Incentive Award. 9. Adjustments Upon Certain Changes Subject to any action by the stockholders of Alphabet
required by law, applicable tax rules or the rules of any exchange on which shares of common stock of Alphabet (for the avoidance
of doubt, references to common stock of Alphabet in this Plan shall include Capital Stock) are listed for trading: (a) Shares Available
for Grants In the event of any change in the number or type of shares of common stock of Alphabet outstanding by reason of any
stock dividend or split, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, combination or exchange of shares or similar corporate change,
or any change in the type and number of shares of common stock of Alphabet outstanding by reason of any other event or transaction,
the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments in the type and maximum aggregate number of shares with respect to which the Committee
may grant Incentive Awards, and the maximum aggregate number of shares with respect to which the Committee may grant Incentive
Awards that are intended to be ISOs. (b) Increase or Decrease in Issued Shares Without Consideration In the event of any increase
or decrease in the number or type of issued shares of common stock of Alphabet resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of
shares of common stock of Alphabet or the payment of a stock dividend (but only on the shares of common stock of Alphabet), or
any other increase or decrease in the number of such shares effected without receipt or payment of consideration by the Company,
the Committee shall appropriately adjust the type or number of shares subject to each outstanding Incentive Award and the exercise
price per share, if any, of shares subject to each such Incentive Award. (c) Certain Mergers In the event of any merger, consolidation
or similar transaction as a result of which the holders of shares of Capital Stock receive consideration consisting exclusively
of securities of the surviving corporation in such transaction, the Committee shall appropriately adjust each Incentive Award outstanding
on the date of such merger or consolidation so that it pertains and applies to the securities which a holder of the number of shares
of Capital Stock subject to such Incentive Award would have received in such merger or consolidation. (d) Certain Other Transactions
In the event of (i) a dissolution or liquidation of Alphabet, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of the Company&rsquo;s assets
(on a consolidated basis) or (iii) a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving Alphabet in which the holders of shares
of Capital Stock receive securities and/or other property, including cash, other than shares of the surviving corporation in such
transaction, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, have the power to: (A) cancel, effective immediately prior to the occurrence
of such event, each Incentive Award (whether or not then exercisable or vested), and, in full consideration of such cancellation,
pay to the Participant to whom such Incentive Award was granted an amount in cash, for each share of Capital Stock subject to such
Incentive Award, equal to the value, as determined by the Committee, of such share of Capital Stock, provided that with respect
to the shares of Capital Stock subject to any outstanding Option such value shall be equal to the excess of (1) the value, as determined

Award with respect to (1) some or all of the property which a holder of the number of shares of Capital Stock subject to such Incentive
Award would have received in such transaction or (2) securities of the acquirer or surviving corporation, and, incident thereto,

Award, or the number of shares or amount of property subject to the Incentive Award or provide for a payment (in cash or other
property) to the Participant to whom such Incentive Award was granted in partial consideration for the exchange of the Incentive
Award. (e) Other Changes In the event of any change in the capitalization of Alphabet or corporate change other than those specifically
referred to in paragraphs 9(b), (c) or (d), including without limitation, any extraordinary cash dividend, spin-off, split-off,
sale of a Subsidiary or business unit, or similar transaction, the Committee may make such adjustments in the issuer, number and
class of shares subject to Stock Incentive Awards outstanding on the date on which such change occurs, such as, for example, a
rollover of Stock Incentive Awards, and in such other terms of such Incentive Award, as the Committee may consider appropriate.
(f) Cash Incentive Awards In the event of any transaction or event described in this Section 9, including without limitation any
corporate change referred to in paragraph (e) hereof, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, make such adjustments of any Cash
Incentive Award, as the Committee may consider appropriate in respect of such transaction or event. (g) No Other Rights Except
as expressly provided in the Plan, no Participant shall have any rights by reason of any subdivision or consolidation of shares
of stock of any class, the payment of any dividend, any increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class or any
dissolution, liquidation, merger or consolidation of Alphabet or any other corporation. Except as expressly provided in the Plan,
no issuance by Alphabet of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect,
and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number of shares or amount of other property subject to,
or the terms related to, any Incentive Award. (h) Savings Clause No provision of this Section 9 shall be given effect to the extent
that such provision would cause any tax to become due under Section 409A of the Code. 10. Rights Under the Plan No Person shall
have any rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares of Capital Stock covered by or relating to any Incentive Award until
the date of the issuance of such shares on the books and records of Alphabet. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section
9 hereof, no adjustment of any Incentive Award shall be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date occurs prior
to the date of such issuance. Nothing in this Section 10 is intended, or should be construed, to limit the authority of the Committee
to cause the Company to make payments based on the dividends that would be payable with respect to any share of Capital Stock if
it were issued or outstanding, or from granting rights related to such dividends. The Company shall not have any obligation to
establish any separate fund or trust or other segregation of assets to provide for payments under the Plan. To the extent any person
acquires any rights to receive payments hereunder from the Company, such rights shall be no greater than those of an unsecured
creditor. 11. No Special Employment Rights; No Right to Incentive Award (a) Nothing contained in the Plan or any agreement evidence
the grant of any Incentive Award shall confer upon any Participant any right with respect to the continuation of his employment
by or service to the Company or interfere in any way with the right of the Company at any time to terminate such employment or
service or to increase or decrease the compensation of the Participant from the rate in existence at the time of the grant of an
Incentive Award. (b) No person shall have any claim or right to receive an Incentive Award hereunder. The Committee&rsquo;s granting
of an Incentive Award to a Participant at any time shall neither require the Committee to grant an Incentive Award to such Participant
or any other Participant or other person at any time nor preclude the Committee from making subsequent grants to such Participant
or any other Participant or other person.</P>

to effect the registration pursuant to the Securities Act of any shares of Capital Stock to be issued hereunder or to effect similar
compliance under any state or local laws. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Alphabet shall not be obligated to cause
to be issued any shares of Capital Stock pursuant to the Plan unless and until Alphabet is advised by its counsel that the issuance
of such shares is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authority and the requirements of any securities
exchange on which shares of Capital Stock are traded. The Committee may require, as a condition to the issuance of shares of Capital
Stock pursuant to the terms hereof, that the recipient of such shares make such covenants, agreements and representations, and
that any certificates representing such shares bear such legends, as the Committee deems necessary or desirable. (b) The exercise
of any Option granted hereunder shall only be effective at such time as counsel to Alphabet shall have determined that the issuance
of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to such exercise is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations of governmental authority
and the requirements of any securities exchange on which shares of Capital Stock are traded. Alphabet may, in its sole discretion,
defer the effectiveness of an exercise of an Option hereunder or the issuance of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to any Incentive
Award pending or to ensure compliance under federal, state or local securities laws. Alphabet shall inform the Participant in writing
of its decision to defer the effectiveness of the exercise of an Option or the issuance of shares of Capital Stock pursuant to
any Incentive Award. During the period that the effectiveness of the exercise of an Option has been deferred, the Participant may,
by written notice, withdraw such exercise and obtain the refund of any amount paid with respect thereto. 13. Withholding Taxes
(a) Cash Remittance Whenever shares of Capital Stock are to be issued upon the exercise of an Option or the grant or vesting of
an Incentive Award, and whenever any amount shall become payable in respect of any Incentive Award, Alphabet shall have the right
to require the Participant to remit to Alphabet in cash an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local withholding tax
requirements, if any, attributable to such exercise, grant, vesting or payment prior to issuance of such shares or the effectiveness
of the lapse of such restrictions or making of such payment. In addition, upon the exercise or settlement of any Incentive Award
in cash, or the making of any other payment with respect to any Incentive Award (other than in shares of Capital Stock), Alphabet
shall have the right to withhold from any payment required to be made pursuant thereto an amount sufficient to satisfy the federal,
state and local withholding tax requirements, if any, attributable to such exercise, settlement or payment. (b) Stock Remittance
At the election of the Participant, subject to the approval of the Committee, when shares of Capital Stock are to be issued upon
the exercise, grant or vesting of an Incentive Award, the Participant may tender to Alphabet a number of shares of Capital Stock
that have been owned by the Participant for at least six months (or such other period as the Committee may determine) having a
Fair Market Value at the tender date determined by the Committee to be sufficient to satisfy withholding tax requirements, if any,
attributable to such exercise, grant or vesting, but in no event exceeding the maximum statutory tax rates of the Participant&rsquo;s
applicable jurisdiction (or such other rate as would not trigger a negative accounting impact), as determined by Alphabet in its
sole discretion. Such election shall satisfy the Participant&rsquo;s obligations under Section 13(a) hereof, if any. (c) Stock
Withholding When shares of Capital Stock are to be issued to a Participant upon the exercise, grant or vesting of an Incentive
Award, Alphabet shall have the authority to withhold a number of such shares having a Fair Market Value at the date of the applicable
taxable event determined by the Committee to be sufficient to satisfy withholding tax requirements, if any, attributable to such
exercise, grant or vesting, but in no event exceeding the maximum statutory tax rates of the Participant&rsquo;s applicable jurisdiction
(or such other rate as would not trigger a negative accounting impact), as determined by Alphabet in its sole discretion. 14. Amendment
or Termination of the Plan The Board of Directors may at any time suspend or discontinue the Plan or revise or amend it in any
respect whatsoever; provided, however, that to the extent that any applicable law, tax requirement, or rule of a stock exchange
requires stockholder approval in order for any such revision or amendment to be effective, such revision or amendment shall not
be effective without such approval. The preceding sentence shall not restrict the Committee&rsquo;s ability to exercise its discretionary
authority hereunder pursuant to Section 4 hereof, which discretion may be exercised without amendment to the Plan. No provision
of this Section 14 shall be given effect to</P>

Participant, reduce the Participant&rsquo;s rights under any previously granted and outstanding Incentive Award. Nothing in the
Plan shall limit the right of the Company to pay compensation of any kind outside the terms of the Plan. 15. No Obligation to Exercise
The grant to a Participant of an Incentive Award shall impose no obligation upon such Participant to exercise such Incentive Award.
16. Transfers Upon Death Upon the death of a Participant, outstanding Incentive Awards granted to such Participant may be exercised
by the Participant&rsquo;s designated beneficiary, provided that such beneficiary has been designated prior to the Participant&rsquo;s
death, to the extent permitted by the Committee (a &ldquo;Permitted Designation&rdquo;). Each such Permitted Designation shall
