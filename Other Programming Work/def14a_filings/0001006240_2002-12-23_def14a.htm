<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I> Your vote is important. Most shareowners have a choice of voting over the Internet, by telephone or by using a traditional proxy card. Please refer to your proxy
card or the information forwarded by
your bank, broker or other nominee to see which options are available to you.  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>REDUCE MAILING COSTS  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I> Eligible shareowners who have more than one account in their name or the same address as other shareowners may authorize us to discontinue mailings of multiple
annual reports and proxy statements.
Most shareowners can also view future annual reports and proxy statements over the Internet rather than receiving paper copies in the mail. See this proxy statement and your proxy card for more
information.  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>ANNUAL MEETING ADMISSION  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I> You will need your admission ticket, as well as a form of personal identification to attend the annual meeting. If you are a shareowner of record, or own Lucent
stock through a Lucent benefit plan, an
admission ticket is included with this mailing. If you own stock through a bank, broker or other nominee, you will need proof of ownership to attend the annual meeting. A recent brokerage statement or
letter from your broker are examples of proof of ownership.  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>CONDUCT OF THE MEETING  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I> In order to insure that the annual meeting is conducted in an orderly fashion and that shareowners wishing to speak at the meeting have a fair opportunity to
speak, we will have certain guidelines and
rules for the conduct of the meeting.  </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are providing these proxy materials in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of Lucent Technologies Inc. of proxies to be voted at our 2003 Annual Meeting of
Shareowners, and at any postponement or adjournment thereof. In this proxy statement, we refer to Lucent Technologies Inc. as "Lucent," "we," "our" or "the company." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
are cordially invited to attend the annual meeting on February&nbsp;19, 2003, beginning at 9&nbsp;a.m. CST. The annual meeting will be held in Lone Star Ballroom A located in the
Adam's Mark Hotel, 400 North Olive Street, Dallas, Texas 75201. Shareowners will be admitted beginning at 8&nbsp;a.m. CST. The location is accessible to handicapped persons and upon request we will
provide wireless headsets for hearing amplification. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
will need your admission ticket as well as a form of personal identification to enter the annual meeting. If you are a shareowner of record, you will find an admission ticket
attached to the proxy card sent to you. If you plan to attend the annual meeting, please
retain the admission ticket. A&nbsp;map and directions to the annual meeting are printed on the admission ticket. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee and you plan to attend the annual meeting, you can obtain an admission ticket in advance by sending a written
request, along with proof of ownership, such as a recent bank or brokerage account statement, to our transfer agent, The Bank of New York, Church Street Station, P.O.&nbsp;Box 11009, New York, New
York 10286. If you arrive at the annual meeting without an admission ticket, we will admit you if we are able to verify that you are a Lucent shareowner. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucent's
fiscal year begins on October&nbsp;1 and ends on September&nbsp;30. References in this proxy statement to the year 2002 or fiscal 2002 refer to the 12-month period from
October&nbsp;1, 2001, through September&nbsp;30, 2002. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are first mailing this proxy statement and accompanying forms of proxy and voting instructions on December&nbsp;23, 2002, to holders of our common stock on December&nbsp;23, 2002,
the record date for the annual meeting. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B> Proxies and Voting Procedures  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because many shareowners cannot attend the annual meeting in person, it is
necessary that a large number of shareowners be represented by proxy. Most shareowners have a choice of voting over the Internet, using a toll-free telephone number or completing a proxy card and
mailing it in the postage-paid envelope provided. Please refer to your proxy card or the information forwarded by your bank, broker or other nominee to see which options are available to you. Please
be aware that if you vote over the Internet, you might incur costs such as telephone and Internet access charges for which you will be responsible. The Internet and telephone voting facilities for
eligible shareowners of record will close at 11:59&nbsp;p.m. EST on February&nbsp;18, 2003. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
can revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by timely delivery of a properly executed, later-dated proxy (including an Internet or telephone vote) or by
voting by ballot at the annual meeting. By providing your voting instructions promptly, you may save the company the expense of a second mailing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareowners by use of a control number and to allow you to confirm that your
instructions have been properly recorded. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The method by which you vote will in no way limit your right to vote at the annual meeting if you later decide to attend in person. If your shares are
held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record, to be able to vote at the annual meeting.

 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
shares entitled to vote and represented by properly completed proxies received prior to the annual meeting, and not revoked, will be voted at the
annual meeting in accordance with your instructions. IF YOU DO NOT INDICATE HOW YOUR SHARES SHOULD BE VOTED ON A MATTER, THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY YOUR PROPERLY COMPLETED PROXY WILL BE VOTED AS THE
BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
any other matters are properly presented for consideration at the annual meeting, including, among other things, consideration of a motion to adjourn the meeting
to another time or place in order to solicit additional proxies in favor of the recommendations of the Board of Directors, the persons named as proxies and acting thereunder will have discretion to
vote on those matters according to their best judgment to the same extent as the person delivering the proxy would be entitled to vote. At the date this proxy statement went to press, we did not
anticipate that any other matters would be raised at the annual meeting. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shareowners
of Lucent common stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the annual meeting. Each common share is entitled to one vote on

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
October&nbsp;1, 2002, there were 3,490,310,034 shares of common stock outstanding. </FONT></P>

purchase plan, shares held in your BuyDIRECT account are included on, and may be voted using, the proxy card sent to you. The plan's administrator is the shareowner of record of your plan shares and
will not vote those shares unless you provide it with instructions, which you can do over the Internet, by telephone or by mail using the proxy card sent to you. </FONT></P>

<P>


<FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Lucent Plan Participants:</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are a participant in the Lucent Savings Plan, Lucent
Long Term Savings and Security Plan, Lucent Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or Lucent Long Term Savings and Security Employee Stock Ownership Trust, you will receive one proxy card for all shares you
own through these plans. That proxy card will serve as a voting instruction card for the trustees or administrators of these plans where all accounts are registered in the same name. To allow
sufficient time for the respective trustee to vote, your voting instructions must be received by February&nbsp;13, 2003. If the trustee does not receive your instructions by that date, the plan
trustee will vote the unvoted plan shares in the same proportion as shares for which instructions were received under each plan. If the administrator for the Lucent Employee Stock Purchase Plan does
not receive your instructions by that date, the administrator will vote shares held in an Employee Stock Purchase Plan account in accordance with normal brokerage industry practices.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you hold Lucent common stock through any other company's stock purchase or savings plan, you will receive voting instructions from that plan's administrator. Please sign and return
those instructions promptly to assure that your shares are represented at the meeting. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Quorum  </B></FONT></P>

<P>


<FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum at the meeting for the
election of directors and for the other proposals. Abstentions and broker "non-votes" are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. A&nbsp;broker
"non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and
has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner.

</FONT>

</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B> Broker "Discretionary Voting"  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
the rules of the New York Stock Exchange in effect at the time this proxy statement was printed, if you hold your shares through a bank or broker, your broker is permitted to vote
your shares on the election of the directors and approval of the 2003 Plan, even if the broker does not receive instructions from you. The New York Stock Exchange has proposed changes to its rules
regarding brokers' discretionary voting authority, which may limit your broker's ability to vote on the proposal relating to the approval of the
2003 Plan unless you provide your broker with voting instructions. If these proposed changes to the New York Stock Exchange rules become effective prior to the annual meeting, your broker may not be
able to vote your shares on this Directors' proposal without receiving instructions from you. </FONT></P>

you are a shareowner of record, you can choose this option and save the company the cost of producing and mailing these documents by marking the appropriate box on your proxy card or

provided if you vote over the Internet. You can also choose between paper documents and electronic access by calling the Lucent Shareowner Services toll-free number, 1&nbsp;888&nbsp;LUCENT6. </FONT></P>

You do not have to elect Internet access each year. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most
shareowners who hold their Lucent stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and who elect electronic access will receive an e-mail message next year containing the Internet

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Multiple Shareholders Sharing the Same Address  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
accordance with a notice sent to eligible shareowners who share a single address, we are sending only one annual report and proxy statement to that address unless we received
instructions to the contrary from any shareowner at that address. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs. However, if a shareowner of record
residing at such an address wishes to receive a separate annual report or proxy statement in the future, he or she may contact our transfer agent at 1&nbsp;888&nbsp;LUCENT6 or write to The Bank of
New York, Church Street Station, P.O. Box 11009, New York, New York 10286. If you are an eligible shareowner of record receiving multiple copies of our annual report and proxy statement, you can
request householding by contacting us in the same manner. If you own your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, you can request householding by contacting the nominee. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Cost of Proxy Solicitation  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucent
will pay the cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies may be solicited on behalf of the company by directors, officers or employees of the company in person or by telephone, facsimile
or other electronic means. We have engaged the firm of Morrow &amp; Co., Inc. to assist us in the distribution and solicitation of proxies. We have agreed to pay Morrow &amp; Co., Inc. a fee of up to $25,000
plus expenses for these services. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
accordance with the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange, we also will reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and
fiduciaries for their expenses incurred in sending proxies and proxy materials to beneficial owners of Lucent common stock as of the record date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Technology Committee  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Technology Committee regularly reviews and appraises the major technological programs being undertaken by Bell Laboratories and other research and development organizations of the
company and determines whether these research and development activities prudently support our overall business objectives and strategies. The Technology Committee also reviews major trends in the
marketplace for our products and services and assesses technologies vital to maintaining our technological leadership. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for this committee setting out the functions that this committee is to perform. A copy of the Technology Committee Charter can be

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
non-employee director receives annually a retainer of $100,000 and an option to purchase 5,000 shares of Lucent common stock. The Chairman of each of the Audit and Finance
Committee, the Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee and the Technology Committee receives an additional retainer of $10,000. Non-employee directors must elect to receive between 50% and
100% of their retainer in Lucent common stock or an option to purchase Lucent common stock or a combination of stock and an option. Any remainder will be paid in cash. Any option elected will enable
the non-employee director to purchase the number of shares resulting from the following formula: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
October 2000, the Board of Directors appointed Mr.&nbsp;Thomas as senior or lead director. In that capacity, Mr.&nbsp;Thomas has day-to-day contact with our management, advising
Mr.&nbsp;Schacht, Ms.&nbsp;Russo and others on a broad range of matters. He has taken on additional corporate governance activities for the Board of Directors. For his services as senior or lead
director, Mr.&nbsp;Thomas receives twice the regular annual compensation received by non-employee directors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
our Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors may&nbsp;defer all or a portion of their cash and stock compensation to a deferred compensation account. Deferred
Compensation Plan accounts have two components, a Lucent stock portion and a cash portion. Non-employee directors can defer receipt of cash retainers to either portion of their accounts. The stock
portion of a retainer can be deferred only to the Lucent stock portion of an account. The value of the Lucent stock portion of an account fluctuates based on changes in the price of Lucent common
stock. Dividend equivalents, when paid, are credited on the Lucent stock portion of accounts. The cash portion of an account earns interest, compounded quarterly, at an annual rate equal (a)&nbsp;to
120% of the average interest rate for 10-year U.S. Treasury notes for the previous quarter, in the case of deferrals after October&nbsp;1, 1997, and (b)&nbsp;to the average interest rate for
10-year U.S. Treasury notes for the previous quarter plus 5%, in the case of deferrals on or before October&nbsp;1, 1997. Interest rates for deferrals to the cash account may be revised by the Board
of Directors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All
distributions from the Lucent stock portion of an account will be made in Lucent common stock. In the event of a Potential Change in Control, as defined in the Deferred Compensation
Plan, the Deferred Compensation Plan will be supported by a benefits protection grantor trust, the assets of which will be subject to the claims of the company's creditors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also maintain a general insurance policy that provides non-employee directors with travel accident insurance when on company business. An individual who became a non-employee director
before 1999 may purchase life insurance under a company program and we will pay a portion of the premium. The amount that we pay is to be returned to us at the earlier of (a)&nbsp;the non-employee
director's death or (b)&nbsp;the later </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiscal 2002, all of our independent directors served on&nbsp;the Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee. Franklin&nbsp;A. Thomas was the Chairman
of the committee. The other committee members were Paul&nbsp;A. Allaire, Robert&nbsp;E. Denham, Daniel&nbsp;S. Goldin, Carla&nbsp;A. Hills and John&nbsp;A. Young. No inside directors serve
on this committee. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Employee Code of Conduct  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our inception in 1996, we have had a Code of Conduct. We require all employees to adhere to the Code of Conduct in addressing the legal and ethical issues
encountered in conducting their work. The Code of Conduct requires that our employees avoid conflicts of interest, comply with all laws and other legal requirements, conduct business in an honest and
ethical manner and otherwise act with integrity and in the company's best interest. During 2002, all of our employees were required to certify that they reviewed and understood the Code of Conduct. In
addition, all officers and senior level executives were required to certify as to any actual or
potential conflicts of interest involving them and the company. We also provide training for our employees on the Code of Conduct and their legal obligations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees
are required to report any conduct that they believe in good faith to be an actual or apparent violation of the Code of Conduct. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require
companies to have procedures to receive, retain and treat complaints received regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and to allow for the confidential and anonymous
submission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. We currently have such procedures in place, and we will monitor any rules adopted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission to determine whether we need to modify our process. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the recommendation of the Audit and Finance Committee, the Board of Directors has reappointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent public accounting
firm to audit our financial statements for the fiscal year beginning October&nbsp;1, 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
making its recommendation to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as the company's independent auditors for the fiscal year beginning October&nbsp;1, 2002, the
Audit and Finance Committee considered whether PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's provision of services other than audit
services are compatible with maintaining independence of our outside accountants. In February&nbsp;2002, we adopted a policy that prohibits use of our independent auditors for any new consulting
services, such as financial system design and implementation, valuation services and actuarial services. In addition, the Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed the fees described below for
non-audit services and believes such fees are compatible with the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Audit Fees  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has billed the company $6,993,000, in the aggregate, for professional services for the audit of our annual financial statements for
fiscal 2002 and for the review of our interim financial statements which are included in our Quarterly Reports on Form&nbsp;10-Q for fiscal 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Financial Information Systems Design and Implementation Fees  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its audit fees, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has billed the company $2,908,000, in the aggregate, for professional services related to financial
information systems design and implementation as described in Paragraph&nbsp;(c)(4)(ii)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;2-01 of Regulation&nbsp;S-X. These fees are for services for
which PricewaterhouseCoopers was retained prior to the time we adopted our policy in February 2002 prohibiting the use of our independent auditor for new consulting services. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Audit and Finance Committee met with management periodically during the year to consider the adequacy of the company's internal controls and the objectivity of its financial

Committee also discussed with the company's
senior management and independent auditors the process used for certifications by the company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer which is required by the Securities and Exchange

and review those financial statements and reports prior to issuance. Management has represented, and PricewaterhouseCoopers&nbsp;LLP has confirmed, to the Audit and Finance Committee that the
financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1997 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on December&nbsp;18, 1996. The 1997 Plan has not been approved by our shareholders. The 1997 Plan provides
for the granting of nonqualified stock options and stock appreciation rights. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
1997 Plan contains an evergreen provision pursuant to which on October&nbsp;1 of each fiscal year the aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance increases by a number of
shares equal to 3.5% of the shares of Lucent common stock issued and outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year or a lesser number determined by the Compensation Committee. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Options
and stock appreciation rights may be granted under the 1997 Plan to any employee who is actively employed by Lucent or its subsidiaries. All option grants have an exercise price
per share that is no less than the fair market value per share of Lucent common stock on the grant date and may have a term of no longer than ten years from grant date. The options generally vest and
become exercisable in installments over the optionee's period of service with the company. The option vests on an accelerated basis in the event of a change in control of the company. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of September&nbsp;30, 2002, options covering 161,420,957 shares of Lucent common stock were outstanding under the 1997 Plan, 298,818,343 shares remained available for future option
grants, and options covering 23,699&nbsp;shares had been exercised during the fiscal year. No stock appreciation rights have been issued under the 1997 Plan. If the 2003 Plan is approved, the 1997
Plan will be amended to limit the number of stock options and other awards that could be granted to an amount equal to the number of awards cancelled under the 1997 Plan, if any, due to expiration or
forfeiture from February&nbsp;19, 2003 through December&nbsp;31, 2003.

Lucent or any of its subsidiaries receive an annual retainer of $100,000 and an option to purchase 5,000 shares of Lucent common stock. The compensation of directors under the Non-Employee
Directors Plan is described more fully under the section entitled "Compensation of Directors" on page 8. Options granted under the Non-Employee Director Plan are fully vested and
non-forfeitable on the grant date and become fully exercisable on the earliest of (i)&nbsp;six months after the grant date, (ii)&nbsp;the occurrence of a change in control, and

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, on November&nbsp;25, 2002 the Board of Directors adopted the Lucent Technologies&nbsp;Inc. 2003 Long Term Incentive Program (the "2003 Plan"), subject to shareowner
approval. The 2003 Plan will allow Lucent to continue to provide long-term incentives, under a shareowner-approved plan, to employees who are responsible for the success and growth of Lucent and to
assist Lucent in attracting and retaining employees of experience and ability. In general, the 2003 Plan empowers Lucent to grant stock options and stock appreciation rights, and to make restricted
stock grants, performance awards and other stock-based and cash-based grants and awards, to executive officers and other employees of Lucent and its subsidiaries. If the 2003 Plan is
approved, the 1996 Plan will be terminated (except with respect to grants and awards then outstanding) and the 1997 Plan will be amended to limit the number stock options and other awards that could
be granted to an amount equal to the number of awards subsequently cancelled, if any, due to their expiration or forfeiture.

with respect to any other property, the fair market value of such property determined by a method established, from time to time, by the Compensation Committee. The 2003 Plan permits the Compensation

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to the provisions of the 2003 Plan and any award agreement, the recipient of an award (including, without limitation, any deferred award) may, if so determined by the

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Federal Income Tax Consequences.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>Options.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that under present law, the following are the U.S. federal income tax consequences
generally arising with respect to stock options. The grant of an option will create no tax consequences for a participant or Lucent. A participant will have no taxable income upon exercising an
incentive stock option after the applicable incentive stock option holding periods have been satisfied (except that the alternative minimum tax may apply), and we will receive no deduction when an
incentive stock option is exercised. Upon exercising an option other than an incentive stock option, a participant must recognize ordinary income equal to the difference between the fair market value
of the shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price. We will be entitled to a deduction for the same amount. The treatment to a participant of a disposition of shares acquired through the
exercise of an option depends on how long the shares were held and on whether the shares were acquired by exercising an incentive stock option or by exercising an option other than an incentive stock
option. Generally, there will be no tax consequence to Lucent in connection with a disposition of shares acquired under an option, except that we may be entitled to a deduction in the case of a
disposition of shares acquired under an incentive stock option before the applicable incentive stock option holding periods have been satisfied. </FONT></P>

tax deductibility. If the 2003 Plan is approved by shareowners, we expect that all stock options, stock appreciation rights and performance awards paid in accordance with the 2003 Plan, and certain

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors has unanimously adopted a resolution seeking shareowner approval to amend Lucent's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a
reverse stock split of Lucent common stock. If the reverse stock split is approved by the shareowners, the Board of Directors may subsequently effect, in its sole discretion, the reverse stock split
based upon any of the following ratios: one-for-ten; one-for-twenty; one-for-thirty; or one-for-forty.
Approval of this proposal
by our shareowners would give the Board of Directors authority to implement the reverse stock split at any time prior to February&nbsp;19, 2004. In addition, notwithstanding approval of this
proposal by the shareowners, the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine not to effect, and abandon, the reverse stock split without further action by our shareowners. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Background  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been a public company and have been a listed company on the New York Stock Exchange since April&nbsp;3, 1996. Since April&nbsp;1, 1999, we have had
approximately 3.5&nbsp;billion shares of common stock outstanding. Since that time, market prices for stocks trading in the United States markets, particularly the telecommunications industry
market, have generally declined. For example, for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30, 2002, the S&amp;P 500 Index and the S&amp;P Telecommunications Equipment Index decreased 29% and 63%, respectively.
In order to reduce the number of shares of Lucent common stock outstanding and thereby attempt to proportionally raise the per share price of Lucent common stock, the Board of Directors believes that
it is in the best interests of our shareowners for the Board of Directors to obtain the authority to implement a reverse stock split. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other requirements, the continued listing standards established by the New York Stock Exchange provide that a company can be delisted if its average closing stock price is below
$1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading day period. On October&nbsp;17, 2002, the average closing stock price of Lucent common stock during the consecutive 30 trading day period prior to such date was

cure this condition by seeking approval from our shareowners at the annual meeting to effect a reverse stock split. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
six months following our receipt of this notice from the New York Stock Exchange, we must attain both a $1.00 share price and a $1.00 average share price over the preceding 30
trading days. Although we have achieved an average share price above $1.00 for a consecutive 30 trading day period from October&nbsp;10, 2002 through November&nbsp;20, 2002, the New York Stock
Exchange will determine if we have cured the price condition only at the end of the six-month period. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure
to achieve this price listing requirement would result in the removal of the listing of Lucent common stock from the New York Stock Exchange. This delisting would likely cause
the trading volume of Lucent common stock to decline and this could result in a decline in the share price of Lucent common stock. Furthermore, this action would increase the likelihood of the removal
of Lucent common stock from key financial indices which could have a further negative impact on our share price. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Board of Directors believes that it is in the interest of our shareowners and Lucent for it to have the authority to effect the reverse stock split in order to return our share price
to a price level typical of share prices of other widely-owned public companies. The Board of Directors believes that the higher share price of Lucent common stock may meet investing guidelines for
certain institutional investors and investment funds. In addition, the Board of Directors believes that our shareowners will benefit from relatively lower trading costs for a higher priced stock. The
combination of lower transaction costs and increased interest from institutional investors and investment funds can ultimately improve the trading liquidity of our common stock. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors believes that shareowner approval of several potential exchange ratios (rather than a single exchange ratio) provides the Board of Directors with the flexibility
to achieve the desired results of the reverse stock split. If the shareowners approve this proposal, the reverse stock split will be effected, if at all, only upon a determination by the Board of
Directors that the reverse stock split is in the best interests of the shareowners at that time. In connection with any determination to effect a reverse stock split, the Board of Directors will set
the timing for such a split and select the specific ratio from among the four ratios set forth herein. No further action on the part of shareowners will be required to either implement or abandon the
reverse stock split. If the Board of Directors does not implement the reverse stock split prior to February&nbsp;19, 2004, the authority granted in this proposal to implement the reverse stock split
on these terms will terminate. The Board of Directors reserves its right to elect not to proceed, and abandon, the reverse stock split if it determines, in its sole discretion, that this proposal is
no longer in the best interests of our shareowners. No further action by our shareowners will be required in order for the Board of Directors to abandon the reverse stock split. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Certain Risk Factors Associated with the Reverse Stock Split  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>There can be no assurance that the total market capitalization of Lucent common stock (the aggregate value of all Lucent common stock at the then market price) after the
proposed reverse stock split will be equal to or greater than the total market capitalization before the proposed reverse stock split or that the per share market price of Lucent common stock
following the reverse stock split will either equal or exceed the current per share market price.</I></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
can be no assurance that the market price per new share of Lucent common stock after the reverse stock split will remain unchanged or increase in proportion to the reduction in the
number of old shares of Lucent common stock
outstanding before the reverse stock split. For example, based on the market price of Lucent common stock on October&nbsp;1, 2002 of $0.76 per share, if the Board of Directors decided to implement
the reverse stock split and selects a reverse stock split ratio of one-for-ten, there can be no assurance that the post-split market price of Lucent common stock
would be $7.60 per share or greater. </FONT></P>

<A NAME="page_dq7729_1_37"> </A>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly,
the total market capitalization of Lucent common stock after the proposed reverse stock split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the proposed reverse
stock split and, in the future, the market price of Lucent common stock following the reverse stock split may not exceed or remain higher than the market price prior to the proposed reverse stock
split. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>If the reverse stock split is effected, the resulting per-share stock price may not attract institutional investors or investment funds and may not satisfy the
investing guidelines of such investors and, consequently, the trading liquidity of Lucent common stock may not improve.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
the Board of Directors believes that a higher stock price may help generate investor interest, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split will result in a per-share
price that will attract institutional investors or investment funds or that such share price will satisfy the investing guidelines of institutional investors or investment funds. As a result, the
trading liquidity of Lucent common stock may not necessarily improve. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>A decline in the market price of Lucent common stock after the reverse stock split may result in a greater percentage decline than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock
split, and the liquidity of Lucent common stock could be adversely affected following such a reverse stock split</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the reverse stock split is effected and the market price of Lucent common stock declines, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of a
reverse stock split. The market price of Lucent
common stock will, however, also be based on Lucent's performance and other factors, which are unrelated to the number of shares outstanding. Furthermore, the liquidity of Lucent common stock could be
adversely affected by the reduced number of shares that would be outstanding after the reverse stock split. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Material Effects of the Proposed Reverse Stock Split  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If approved and effected, the reverse stock split will be realized simultaneously for all of Lucent common stock and the ratio will be the same for all of Lucent
common stock. The reverse stock split will affect all of Lucent's shareowners uniformly and will not affect any shareowner's percentage ownership interests in Lucent, except to the extent that the
reverse stock split would otherwise result in any of Lucent's shareowners owning a fractional share or option. As described below, </FONT></P>

shareowners otherwise entitled to fractional shares as a result of the reverse stock split will be entitled to cash payments in lieu of such fractional shares. Such cash payments will reduce the
number of post-reverse stock split shareowners to the extent there are shareowners presently who would otherwise receive less than one share of Lucent common stock after the reverse stock
split. In addition, the reverse stock split will not affect any shareowner's percentage ownership or proportionate voting power (subject to the treatment of fractional shares). However, because the
number of authorized shares of Lucent common stock will not be reduced, the reverse stock split will increase the Board of Directors' ability to issue authorized and unissued shares without further
shareowner action. </FONT></P>

all fractional shares and sell them as soon as practicable after the effective date at the then prevailing prices on the open market, on behalf of those holders who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fractional share. We expect that the transfer agent will conduct the sale in an orderly fashion at a reasonable pace and that it may take several days to sell all of the aggregated
fractional shares of common stock. After completing such sale, you will receive a cash payment from the transfer agent in an amount equal to your pro rata share of the total net proceeds of that sale.
No transaction
costs will be assessed on this sale, however, the proceeds will be subject to federal income tax. In addition, you will not be entitled to receive interest for the period of time between the effective
date of the reverse stock split and the date you receive your payment for the cashed-out shares. The payment amount will be paid to the holder in the form of a check in accordance with the
procedures outlined below. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
the reverse stock split, you will have no further interest in Lucent with respect to your cashed-out shares. A person otherwise entitled to a fractional interest will
not have any voting, dividend or other rights except to receive payment as described above. </FONT></P>

Lucent common stock issued and outstanding based on the reverse stock split ratio selected by the Board of Directors. As of October&nbsp;1, 2002, we had 10&nbsp;billion shares of authorized common
stock and 3,490,310,034 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. We will continue to have 250,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock. Authorized but unissued shares will be available for

than the cash payments for fractional shares discussed below, no gain or loss should be recognized by a shareowner upon such shareowner's exchange of pre-reverse stock
split shares for post-reverse stock split shares pursuant to the reverse stock split. The aggregate tax basis of the post-reverse stock split shares received in the reverse
stock split (including any fraction of a post-reverse stock split share deemed to have been received) will be the same as the shareowner's aggregate tax basis in the
pre-reverse stock split shares exchanged therefor. In general, shareowners who receive cash
in exchange for their fractional share interests in the post-reverse stock split shares as a result of the reverse stock split will recognize gain or loss based on their adjusted basis in
the fractional share interests redeemed. The shareowner's holding period for the post-reverse stock split shares will include the period during which the shareowner held the
pre-reverse stock split shares surrendered in the reverse stock split. </FONT></P>

receipt of cash instead of a fractional share of Lucent common stock by a United States holder of Lucent common stock will result in a taxable gain or loss to such holder for federal
income tax purposes based upon the difference between the amount of cash received by such holder and the adjusted tax basis in the fractional shares as set forth above. The gain or loss will
constitute a capital gain or loss and will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if the holder's holding period is greater than one year as of the effective date. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Davis has presented this proposal every year since 1998 to our shareowners. Last year, the proposal received an affirmative vote of 57.5% of the shares voting.
Although reflecting a majority of shares voting and an increase in the level of support from past years, it is only 27.8% of the outstanding common shares entitled to vote&#151;significantly
less than the 80% of the outstanding shares necessary to amend the specific section of the company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to allow for the annual election of directors. </FONT></P>

meeting, the Board of Directors undertook a comprehensive review of Lucent's corporate governance practices, including the structure and the function of the Board of Directors and its committees. We
have concluded that the classified board continues to be in the best interests of our shareowners. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that a classified board reduces our vulnerability to certain unfriendly or unsolicited takeover tactics. Potential acquirors, if any, would find it necessary to use arm's
length
negotiations with management and the Board of Directors. The company, therefore, would be in a better position to seek the best possible outcome for shareowners. In addition, because at least two
shareowner meetings would be required to effect a change in control of the Board, a majority of the directors at any given time would be familiar with the company's business strategy through service
as a director. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also believe that the classified board structure encourages continuity and stability of leadership and policymaking, since a majority of the directors at any given time will have
prior experience as directors and will be familiar with our business strategies and operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the common shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the shareowners proposal
is required to approve the shareowner proposal, which is framed as a "recommendation" to the Board. An abstention is treated as being present and entitled to vote on the matter and, therefore, has the
effect of a vote against the shareowner proposal. A&nbsp;broker "non-vote" is treated as not being entitled to vote on the matter and, therefore, is not counted for purposes of determining whether
the shareowner proposal has been approved. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our committee has two primary responsibilities. First, we oversee the company's corporate governance principles and practices. Second, we set the company's compensation principles that
serve to guide the design of compensation plans and programs applicable to employees at all levels of the organization. In discharging our role, we periodically conduct reviews of both corporate
governance and compensation practices. We annually benchmark the ongoing competitiveness of the company's compensation programs in order to evaluate whether they are achieving the desired goals and
objectives summarized in this report. We also review the performance of the senior leadership team and establish individual compensation levels for each member, having considered the advice of

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Compensation Philosophy and Programs Review  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extensive study of our compensation philosophy and programs was conducted during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2002. With the assistance of independent
advisors, we evaluated our current programs and policies against current and emerging competitive practice and against emerging legal or regulatory developments. We also had our advisors survey our
employees, hold focus groups and interview several of our senior leaders to gain their feedback and input on the effectiveness of our current compensation program. Based on these inputs, we have made
some modifications to our overall program, and to specific plans. Those changes will be discussed throughout the balance of our report. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Executive Compensation Guiding Principles  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of our compensation program is to attract, motivate and retain the highly talented individuals Lucent needs to design and deliver innovative products,
services and solutions to our customers. The following principles influence the design and administration of our compensation program: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>Compensation should be related to performance</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
believe that an employee's compensation should be tied not just to how the individual employee performs, but also to how well both the employee's team and the company perform against
both financial and non-financial goals and objectives, as set forth in the company's Balanced Scorecard. When the company's performance is better than the objectives set for the
performance period, employees should be paid more and when the company's performance does not meet one or more of the key objectives, any incentive award payment is at the committee's discretion. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>Incentive compensation should be a greater part of total compensation for more senior positions</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
proportion of an employee's total compensation that varies with individual, team and company performance objectives should increase as the scope and level of the individual's
business responsibilities increase. For fiscal years 1997 through 2001, between 80% to over 90% of the total target pay opportunity of the Chief Executive Officer was at risk </FONT></P>

against short and long term performance goals. For fiscal year 2002, the company's Chief Executive Officer, Patricia F. Russo, will be paid under the terms of her employment agreement outlined on
page&nbsp;64. In general, the amount of total target pay at risk against short and long term performance goals for all other officers of the company ranges from 65% to 80%.

 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>Incentive compensation should balance short and long-term performance</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2>Through the design of our compensation program, we look to balance the focus of all employees on achieving strong short-term, or annual, results in a manner
that will ensure the company's long-term viability and success. Therefore, to reinforce the importance of balancing these perspectives, our employees are regularly provided with both
annual and long-term incentives. Participation in the long-term incentive programs increases at higher levels of responsibility as employees in these leadership roles have the
greatest influence on the company's strategic direction and results over time. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>Lucent employees should be provided with opportunities to own Lucent stock</B></FONT></P>

<P>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=2>We provide our employees at all levels with various ways to become shareowners. We have made stock option grants to broad segments of employees and have programs that are
intended to increase stock ownership among employees. These programs include stock option plans under which we make discretionary stock option grants to employees worldwide, 401(k) savings plans that
allow U.S. employees to invest, on a voluntary basis, in company stock, and a stock purchase plan which enables employees to purchase Lucent stock at a discount through payroll deductions. Our goal in
providing these opportunities is to align the interests of each employee with the interests of our shareowners. For fiscal year 2003, we are adopting stock ownership guidelines for officers of the
company, discussed in further detail on page 55.

SIZE=2><B>Compensation levels should be competitive</B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2>
To achieve the above goals, we review compensation survey data from several independent sources to ensure that our total compensation program is competitive. Companies selected for the survey are
those with whom we compete for executive talent. We target overall (or total) executive compensation to deliver pay levels between the median and the 75th percentile of a comparison group of
technology and other select large, global, public companies when we achieve a set of aggressive and challenging goals and </FONT></P>

objectives designed to increase shareowner value. This comparison group is used because the company's competitors for executive talent are not necessarily the same companies that are included in the
indices used to compare shareowner returns (see Performance Graph, page 49) due to the fact that the company generally requires skills from a more varied set of backgrounds.

 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>We seek to maximize the tax deductibility of compensation as appropriate</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
is also our goal to have most of the compensation paid to the company's chief executive officer and four other most highly compensated executive officers qualify as performance based
and deductible for federal income tax purposes under Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. We have structured most of our compensation plans so that amounts paid under those plans will
be fully deductible. However, some of the compensation that we pay cannot be deducted. The compensation paid to those officers that cannot be deducted includes salary, the value of perquisites and
restricted stock unit awards, to the extent that the value of these compensation components exceeds $1&nbsp;million. Based on the complexity of our business, and the rapidly changing nature of our
industry, as well as the continued competitive market for outstanding leadership talent, we believe it is appropriate to provide that compensation, even though it is not fully
tax-deductible. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Components of Our Compensation Program  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four primary components of our compensation program are: Base Salary, Annual Incentives, Long Term Incentives, and Special Grants. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><B>Base Salary</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
set base salaries for all officers at levels that are competitive with similar positions at other comparable companies. While we conduct surveys annually, we usually adjust salaries
for those at a senior level either when our
surveys show a significant deviation versus market or to recognize outstanding individual performance. This is in line with our philosophy that compensation above competitive levels should come
primarily from the variable portion of the compensation package, especially for our senior leaders. </FONT></P>

compensation to align officer pay with the annual (short-term) performance of the company. In 2002, the measures for annual incentives were based on corporate earnings per share and cash flow
objectives. If those objectives are met, the payment of actual awards is tied to the individual's performance, as well as that of the team for which the officer is responsible. The committee
determines the assessment of individual and team performance at the end of the year. When we evaluate individual performance, we consider each leader's performance against the Balanced Scorecard
performance metrics in the categories of financial, customer and people. In addition, we assess each leader in terms of their leadership and managerial ability, business knowledge, execution of
Lucent's restructuring plan and overall business strategy, and adherence to our values. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
company did not reach the corporate earnings per share and cash flow objectives necessary to generate annual incentive funding for officers. Given the significant accomplishments of
many dedicated employees that have helped Lucent achieve its restructuring plan and position it for future success, we have nevertheless authorized a funding pool for annual incentive awards. This
represents approximately one third of the funding that would have been available had our corporate performance goals been met. We believe it is critical to the future success of this business that we
recognize employees' accomplishments and efforts on behalf of our shareowners. Lucent officers were not eligible to receive awards from this discretionary funding. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><B>Long Term Incentives</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
recent years, we have chosen to use stock options as the primary form of long-term incentives. We generally make grants of stock options to officers once a year. These
annual grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a share on the day we grant the options. Historically, these option grants generally vest within three years and expire five
years from the date of the grant. Target grant guidelines are developed based on our market compensation benchmarking. Actual grants awarded to individuals are adjusted based on each officer's
individual performance, retention considerations and other special circumstances. </FONT></P>

being implemented to our long-term incentive program as a result of the compensation philosophy and programs review discussed earlier in this report. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to stock option grants, a new long-term incentive plan is being introduced for those in leadership positions (approximately 1,000 employees). Under this new plan,
participants are eligible to receive a cash payment for the annual achievement of performance objectives over a three-year period. This new long-term plan is designed to focus
the leadership team on driving for continuous operational improvements that are critical to the future sustained success of the business. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to stock option grants, several changes are being implemented effective with grants awarded for fiscal year 2003, as well as those awarded thereafter under the 2003 Plan, if
it is approved by shareowners. A detailed overview of the 2003 Plan is provided on pages&nbsp;22-33 in this proxy statement. The changes we have made include various provisions that will serve to
ensure both the motivational and retention value of equity grants is maintained. Key changes include extension of the standard vesting period of an option grant from three years to four and the
standard option term from five years to seven, and revisions to grant guidelines that made participation and grant size more closely aligned with performance.

 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have reviewed issues relating to the potential expensing of stock option grants and have determined that this would not be in our shareholders' interests at this time. We are
currently in compliance with Financial Accounting Standards Board guidelines and will adjust our practices as these guidelines evolve. </FONT></P>

circumstances, a special equity grant may take the form of a stock option, restricted stock units or a combination of the two. Special equity grants may have different vesting periods than annual
awards. During the 2002 fiscal year, in order to retain key members of management and to further align the interests of management with the shareholders, we awarded special one-time equity
grants of stock options and restricted stock units. All or a portion of the cash retention awards made to officers in the 2001 fiscal year were paid during the 2002 fiscal year. No new cash retention
awards were granted to any officer during the 2002 fiscal year. </FONT></P>

paid a set annual base salary of $1,200,000 for the first two years in which she serves as Chief Executive
Officer, with annual reviews thereafter, and increases at the committee's discretion. She is also eligible for annual incentive awards at a target equal to 150% of her base salary if the performance
goals established for the relevant year are met. For the 2002 fiscal year, Ms.&nbsp;Russo was paid a guaranteed bonus of $1,800,000 in accordance with the terms of her employment agreement. In part,
this payment was awarded in recognition of the compensation opportunity Ms. Russo forfeited upon leaving her prior employer, and was provided in lieu of other compensation such as a cash sign-on bonus
or additional equity grants. She does not have a guaranteed annual award for the 2003 fiscal year. In addition, Ms.&nbsp;Russo is eligible for awards under the company's long-term
incentive programs at the committee's discretion. Ms.&nbsp;Russo was provided with relocation benefits that included moving expenses and a provision that required the company to purchase
Ms.&nbsp;Russo's home in Rochester, New York. However, Ms.&nbsp;Russo found a buyer for her home and did not exercise her right to require the company to purchase the home. </FONT></P>

value of such restricted stock units was $1,335,970 (on such date the price of Lucent common stock on a post-Agere Systems spin basis was $0.76). The stock options granted to Ms.&nbsp;Russo upon her

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
market conditions have declined and the outlook for recovery within the telecommunications industry has been prolonged, it has become critical for the company to recognize the
contributions employees have made thus far to improving the operating performance of the business, as noted earlier in our report. The strength of our business is built on long and deep relationships
with our customers and knowledge of their networks. Therefore, to continue to meet our customers' needs, it is essential for the company to retain talent and to keep employees engaged and motivated
during this challenging time. To address these needs, the committee approved a stock option exchange program. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Stock Option Exchange Offer was a voluntary program that allowed eligible employees to exchange some or all of their eligible current underwater stock options, that had generally
been granted in February&nbsp;2001 or earlier, for the opportunity to receive an option for a smaller number of shares at a current market price. Eligible employees were required to declare their
election to participate in the program before May&nbsp;23, 2002, at which time the options they elected to exchange were cancelled. In order for the company to avoid adverse accounting treatment,

though many of the options employees elected to exchange were partially or fully vested, the new option grant was unvested and will not be fully vested until two and

outstanding by approximately 90 million shares. </FONT></P>

counsel and corporate secretary and now has responsibility for human resources; law and government affairs; environmental, health and safety; corporate governance and compliance; and philanthropy. </FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=1>(3)</FONT></DT><DD><FONT

accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission rules, we have used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date present value of the options set forth in
this table. Our use of this model should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy at valuing options. All stock option valuation models, including the Black-Scholes model, require a
prediction about the future movement of the stock price. The real value of the options in this table depends upon the actual changes in the market price of Lucent's common stock during the applicable
period.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Service Based Program generally covers most management employees hired prior to January&nbsp;1, 1999. Pensions provided under this program are computed on an adjusted career
average pay basis. A participant's adjusted career average pay is equal to 1.4% of the sum of the individual's (a)&nbsp;average annual pay for the five years ending December&nbsp;31, 1998
(excluding the annual bonus award paid in December&nbsp;1997) times the number of years of service prior to January&nbsp;1, 1999, (b)&nbsp;pay subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 1998, and
(c)&nbsp;annual bonus award paid in December&nbsp;1997. Average annual pay used in the Service Based Program includes base salary and annual bonus awards. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal
laws place limitations on compensation amounts that may be included under the pension plan. In 2002, up to $200,000 in eligible base salary and annual bonus could be included in
the calculation under this plan. Pension benefits applicable to compensation amounts which are within federal limitations are funded by a pension trust that is separate from the general assets of the
company. Pension benefits applicable to compensation which exceeds federal limitations are paid under the company's supplemental pension plan, which is described later in this section, and is funded
from the company's general assets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
normal retirement age under this plan is 65; however, employees who are at least age 50 with at least 15&nbsp;years of service can retire with reduced benefits under the Service
Based Program. If an employee's age (which must be at least 50)&nbsp;plus service, when added together, is equal to or greater than 75&nbsp;years the employee may retire with unreduced pension
benefits. A&nbsp;reduction in pension benefits equal to 3% is made for each year age plus service is less than 75. Once vested, normally after five years of service, an employee participating in the
Account Balance Program is entitled to the amounts in his or her account when he or she leaves the company. </FONT></P>

executive officers and surviving spouses may receive an annual minimum pension equal to 15% of the sum of final base salary plus annual bonus awards. This minimum pension will be offset by pensions
under the management and supplemental pension plans. We have eliminated this 15% minimum benefit for new officers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
estimated total annual pension payable to Ms. Russo, Messrs.&nbsp;Holder, O'Shea, D'Amelio and Rawson if they continue in their current positions and retire at age 65, is
$1,167,962; $674,754; $690,236; $766,753 and $543,884, respectively. These amounts assume these individuals select a straight life annuity, which provides no ongoing pension benefit to a surviving
spouse following the death of the retired employee. Other optional forms of payment may be selected which do provide continuing survivor benefits, and which subject the pension amount to a
corresponding actuarial reduction. Ms.&nbsp;Russo is also eligible for a special pension arrangement under the terms of her employment agreement. This is detailed below in the section entitled
"Executive Agreements and Other Relationships." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
of our non-qualified executive benefit plans will be supported by a benefits protection grantor trust, the assets of which are subject to the claims of the company's
creditors. In the event of a Change in Control or Potential Change in Control of the company (as such terms are defined in the applicable plans), certain additional funds might be required to be
contributed to such trust to support benefits under such plans. </FONT></P>

Mr.&nbsp;Schacht, who now serves as Chairman. Ms.&nbsp;Russo returned to Lucent from the Eastman Kodak Company, bringing a deep knowledge of our industry and our customers coupled with the ability
to lead a large organization through change. When Ms.&nbsp;Russo rejoined Lucent, we entered into an agreement that set out our understanding with her on a number of subjects. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
agreement provides that we will pay Ms.&nbsp;Russo a salary that will be no less than $1,200,000 per year and a target bonus equal to 150% of her base salary. For 2002, we agreed
to pay Ms.&nbsp;Russo a bonus of at least $1,800,000 to, in part, address the compensation opportunity </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Transition Arrangements  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognized at the beginning of fiscal 2001 that it would take significant commitment, dedication, and effort to work through this difficult time for Lucent
with focus and speed. We knew that it was important to have the right leadership with the knowledge and capabilities required to execute our turnaround with a sense of urgency. To ensure that highly
qualified key members of management would stay to see this work through despite considerable personal uncertainty, we developed (1)&nbsp;severance protection arrangements and (2)&nbsp;retention
payments for selected officers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
to severance protection, generally those executive officers who are eligible for the severance coverage are provided two years of base salary and target bonus if their employment is
terminated by the company for reasons other than cause. During this two-year period, they will also continue to receive benefit coverage and equity vesting. Such coverage has been provided
to Ms. Russo and to Messrs.&nbsp;Holder, O'Shea, </FONT></P>

D'Amelio and Rawson, among others. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, as disclosed in the company's proxy statement for the prior year, in fiscal 2001 we chose to provide enhanced severance coverage for those officers most likely to be
directly impacted by a change in leadership at the CEO level. To ensure that Messrs.&nbsp;Holder, O'Shea and Rawson would stay with Lucent during the critical period of fiscal 2001 rather than
retire or seek jobs elsewhere despite the personal uncertainty created by a prospective change in CEO
leadership, we provided them the deferred right to terminate their employment and receive severance payments within six months of the appointment of a new CEO, upon a change in their reporting
relationship to Mr.&nbsp;Schacht, or on or after April&nbsp;22, 2002 (the eighteen month anniversary of Mr.&nbsp;Schacht's appointment) for any reason. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to severance protection, special retention award arrangements were put in place in fiscal 2001 as disclosed in the company's proxy statement for the prior year to ensure
continuity of leadership into fiscal 2002 and beyond as the company continues its critical restructuring work. Selected officers, including Mr.&nbsp;D'Amelio, received a cash retention payment to be
paid in two parts: 50% in February&nbsp;2002 and 50% in December&nbsp;2002, assuming continued employment with the company or involuntary termination without cause. In Mr.&nbsp;D'Amelio's case,
a payment of $1,500,000 was made on February&nbsp;1, 2002, and the remaining $1,500,000 was paid on December&nbsp;1, 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to enhanced severance protection, special retention arrangements were also developed to ensure the continued employment of Messrs.&nbsp;Holder, O'Shea, and Rawson to and
beyond April&nbsp;22, 2002. Under these arrangements each would be eligible to receive a cash retention payment equal to two times his base salary and annual target bonus at the time of payment.
This payment was to be made April&nbsp;22, 2002 or upon commencement of employment of a new CEO, whichever came first. This enhanced retention arrangement ensured that the incentives for senior
management to remain in leadership positions within the company were greater than the benefits they could have received under a self-initiated severance agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
the appointment of Ms.&nbsp;Russo as CEO on January&nbsp;6, 2002, Mr.&nbsp;Holder received a retention payment of </FONT></P>

$4,500,000, Mr.&nbsp;O'Shea received a retention payment of $3,080,000 and Mr.&nbsp;Rawson received a retention payment of $2,310,000. They also received full vesting of their current outstanding
stock options and restricted stock units. Messrs.&nbsp;Holder, O'Shea and Rawson are also entitled to ongoing severance coverage comparable to that of other officers. In order to provide a
strong incentive for continuity beyond April&nbsp;2002, in November&nbsp;2001, we granted Mr.&nbsp;Holder an equity grant of 300,000 stock options and 300,000 restricted stock units, and, in
December&nbsp;2001, we granted to each of Mr.&nbsp;Holder and Mr.&nbsp;O'Shea additional equity grants of 500,000 stock options and 500,000 restricted stock units. These grants were not subject
to the accelerated vesting provisions described above. The options and restricted stock units noted above have subsequently been adjusted to reflect the spin-off of Agere Systems. </FONT></P>

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, if the Committee determines at the time Restricted Stock, a Performance Award or an Other Stock Unit Award is granted to a
Participant that such Participant is, or may be as of the end of the tax year for which the Company would claim a tax deduction in connection with such Award, a Covered Employee, then the Committee
